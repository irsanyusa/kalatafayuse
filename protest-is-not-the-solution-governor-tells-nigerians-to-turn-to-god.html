Namadi advised Nigerians to accept the hardships as a trial from God, adding that every Muslim believes in destiny whether good or bad.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The Police Commissioner in Jigawa, <strong>Tijjani Abdullahi</strong>, in a remark, warned those who insisted on participating in the proposed August 1 protest to have a second thought.</p><p>“The security agencies in the state are combat ready to deal with anyone who wants to breach public peace and order,” he said.</p><p>Similarly, <strong>Brig.-Gen.

Young people are engaged in kidnappings and armed robbery all due to the influences of hard drugs and other substances.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“Citizens must quickly repent and seek God’s forgiveness and His intervention."</p><p>CAN Chairman in Jigawa, <strong>Rev. Father Maurice Hassan</strong>, urged the government to do the needful by controlling the prices of commodities to prevent unpatriotic traders from raising prices without justification.</p><p>Hassan declared that CAN would not be part of the protest, adding that the association would support and promote peaceful coexistence among residents. The CAN chairman also called on the government to find a lasting solution to the challenges in the country.</p><p>Also speaking, <strong>Sunusi Maigatari</strong>, Chairman of the NLC in Jigawa, said that his group would not be part of the protest because the issue was not part of its agenda at the last National Working Committee meeting.</p><p><strong>Abdullahi Garba</strong>, Chairman, of NANS, also disassociated students from the planned protest and assured the governor that they would not allow any group, in whichever name, to destabilise the peaceful co-existence in Jigawa.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Dr Adamu Maje</strong>, the Emir of Hadejia and Chairman of the Traditional Council of Rulers, in his remarks, expressed concern over hardships, insisting, however, that the protest was not the solution.</p><p>The traditional ruler said that the people in Jigawa were very peaceful and law-abiding citizens.</p><p>“If you see anyone protesting in Jigawa, that person or group of persons cannot be from the state,” he added.</p><p>Similarly, the Emir of Dutse, <strong>Muhammad Hameem</strong>, urged Nigerians to find other ways of presenting their grievances through rightful legal channels and not through such “undefined” protests.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXyxvs6tnKysXZ7AbrrOrWStoJViwLC41K2gqKZdnLy3sdGnpqtlpJq5rb%2BMp6CgnaKerq%2B%2FjK2mZqylp7tuwM5mnqicX6CEucOYbpo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
