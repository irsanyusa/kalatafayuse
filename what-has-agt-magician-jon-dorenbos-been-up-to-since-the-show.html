The former football player competed on Season 11 of the show in 2016. You might be wondering where he’s been since his time on AGT.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jon-dorenbos-finished-agt-season-11-in-third-place>Jon Dorenbos Finished ‘AGT’ Season 11 in Third Place</h2><p>Dorenbos started playing football in the NFL in 2003. He played for the Buffalo Bills, Tennessee Titans, and Philadelphia Eagles. In 2016, he auditioned for America’s Got Talent as a magician. Dorenbos impressed the judges with a card trick, earning four “yes” votes to move on.</p><p>In the Judge Cuts, Dorenbos wowed guest judge Ne-Yo with another card routine in which he made the singer’s chosen card appear to pop out of a drawing. Ne-Yo was so impressed, he hit the Golden Buzzer for Dorenbos, sending him straight to the live shows.</p><p>Dorenbos made it all the way to the Finals, where he finished the competition in fifth place. He later returned for AGT: The Champions in 2019. Although he was eliminated after his first performance, he returned as a wildcard act in the Finals. Dorenbos also appeared as a guest performer in Season 15.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>JON DORENBOS: ‘AMERICA’S GOT TALENT’S REAL LIFE SUPERHERO</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-has-dorenbos-been-up-to-since-the-show>What Has Dorenbos Been Up to Since the Show?</h2><p>In 2017, Dorenbos was traded from the Eagles to the New Orleans Saints. Shortly afterward, he was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm and needed immediate surgery. He retired from football but received a Super Bowl ring after the Eagles won in 2018.</p><p>Dorenbos married his wife Annalise Dale in 2017, and they welcomed a daughter named Amaya Love in 2019. Over the years, the magician made several appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, performing magic tricks and surprising fans. He also works as a keynote speaker, and he published a book called Life Is Magic in 2019.</p><p>Starting August 19, Dorenbos will be a Guest Host at the <a href=#>AGT Las Vegas LIVE show</a> at the Luxor Theater. He’ll appear in shows through September 11, and fans can add a meet and greet with the magician to their ticket, including a photo opportunity and a copy of his book.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AGT-Results-2022.png alt="‘AGT’ Results: Surprising Elimination as Two Acts Go to the Finals" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>jon dorenbos</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGYrWWYlsBurcatZKaZl56wqq3NZqGopl2ZvLOxzZumrGWSmrKvedSpZK2nXai2r6%2FEZquhnV2otbDDjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
