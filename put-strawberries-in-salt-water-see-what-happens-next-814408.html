Soaking your strawberries in saltwater before eating them can help get rid of any pests left living on the fruit. You put them in the saltwater, returning a short time later.
What you find on your strawberries is something more like a scary movie than a delicious treat!

You put them in&nbsp;the saltwater, returning a&nbsp;short time later.</p><p>What you find on&nbsp;your strawberries is&nbsp;something more like a&nbsp;scary movie than a&nbsp;delicious treat! Little maggots crawling all over your fresh delicacy! What’s going on&nbsp;here?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6a4/4bb/1b599457c9ab3bd947594243a8.png><p>These gross little maggots aren’t really maggots at&nbsp;all. They’re none other than the larvae of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fruit fly! Tiny little wriggling fruit fly babies escaping from the salt bath! Larvae aren’t the only things that have been found in&nbsp;strawberries either. Caterpillars and <a href=# title=spiders data-link=tag>spiders</a> have been known to&nbsp;hide away in&nbsp;these sweet tasty spots, unaware we’re getting ready to&nbsp;eat them as&nbsp;well! There’s a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;test your food if&nbsp;you really want&nbsp;to.</p><p>To&nbsp;do&nbsp;this at&nbsp;home, all you need is&nbsp;salt <a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a> and some patience. Soak your fruit in&nbsp;the salty water for 30&nbsp;minutes and wait and see if&nbsp;little <a href=# title=insects data-link=tag>insects</a> are escaping your food. If&nbsp;none appear, that still doesn’t mean you’re safe. They might just be&nbsp;really good at&nbsp;hiding!</p><p>Fruit flies love to&nbsp;lay their eggs in&nbsp;ripe fruit, and we’ve been eating them for a&nbsp;very long time. Scientists don’t believe there’s any harm from eating bugs and there’s a&nbsp;good reason why. There are bugs in&nbsp;everything we&nbsp;eat!</p><p>Caterpillars have always been found in&nbsp;apples, and sometimes you won’t notice you have an&nbsp;infested apple until you find a&nbsp;caterpillar staring back at&nbsp;you! Fruit flies also don’t go&nbsp;just after strawberries either, they will lay their eggs in&nbsp;all sorts of&nbsp;fruit!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/307/5dd/f0f4cc579b80cea44229b2e2ed.png><p>Peaches, grapes, and even cherries aren’t safe! Nothing’s new about salt testing, however; this practice has been around with farmers for years.</p><p>Farmers regularly check handfuls of&nbsp;their produce in&nbsp;salty water to&nbsp;make sure they aren’t infested. Does this mean that you might’ve been eating these little larvae for quite some time? Well yes! The good news is&nbsp;that these little creatures won’t spoil your fruit, and you wouldn’t have ever found them normally.</p><p>A&nbsp;little extra bug protein can’t be&nbsp;bad for our smoothies at&nbsp;all if&nbsp;you don’t mind the crunch sometimes! I&nbsp;wouldn’t recommend using salt water to&nbsp;clean your strawberries&nbsp;— the salt can take away that sweet taste you’re craving.</p><p>Freshwater should be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;help get rid of&nbsp;any pesticides and insect pieces left on&nbsp;the outside. This should be&nbsp;done the same way we&nbsp;wash our hands, for 20–30&nbsp;seconds. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great way to&nbsp;preserve the taste of&nbsp;your fruit and remove any residue as&nbsp;well. <a href=# title=Vinegar data-link=tag>Vinegar</a> and water work well too!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8aa/37b/576e7c5552a32fb017a4adfa11.png><p>Having tiny insects in&nbsp;my&nbsp;food rather than big spiders is&nbsp;something&nbsp;I would prefer any day! Look at&nbsp;these long legs and those eyes! A&nbsp;family in&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK bought a&nbsp;lovely bunch of&nbsp;bananas at&nbsp;their local shop in&nbsp;2016 but didn’t realize that unexpected guests were coming home with them as&nbsp;well! These spiders decided to&nbsp;come out of&nbsp;their nest and explore their new home, much to&nbsp;the fright of&nbsp;the family!</p><p>The bananas came from Brazil, and the Brazilian wandering spider followed its name properly and came to&nbsp;the UK. Not surprisingly, the family had to&nbsp;vacate their home to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;the unwanted spiders and probably won’t buy bananas ever again!</p><p>The truth with all fruit and vegetables is&nbsp;that there are always going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;insects found in&nbsp;and on&nbsp;them. If&nbsp;little bugs crawling out of&nbsp;fruit make you feel uneasy, I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;tell you that you’ve been eating them voluntarily for quite some time!</p><p>For many years, red food coloring has been made from one source. A&nbsp;tiny beetle. This beetle lives mainly in&nbsp;South America and has been used to&nbsp;color anything from cakes and candy to&nbsp;even being in&nbsp;your favorite cup of&nbsp;<a href=# title=coffee data-link=tag>coffee</a> a&nbsp;few years ago!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/994/a30/4c73ff565b9dfa9ffa0b193da4.png><p>If&nbsp;eating beetles bothers you, all you need to&nbsp;look for is&nbsp;E120&nbsp;or natural red 4&nbsp;on the package to&nbsp;know if&nbsp;you’re going to&nbsp;eat delicious bugs! Major companies have stopped using this form of&nbsp;food coloring, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to&nbsp;stop eating bugs.</p><p>That shine on&nbsp;your favorite candy also comes from the Indian female lac bug. The beetle leaves behind a&nbsp;substance that is&nbsp;scraped from the trees to&nbsp;be&nbsp;formed into dried shellac! In&nbsp;many countries, it’s a&nbsp;very common thing to&nbsp;eat, and a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;scientists believe we&nbsp;should be&nbsp;consuming more bugs.</p><p>In&nbsp;Thailand, China, and Japan, it’s common to&nbsp;walk along the streets and find interesting crickets and silkworms available to&nbsp;eat! In&nbsp;<a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a>, the Aborigines eat the honey-pot ant and witchetty grubs that are full of&nbsp;nutrition, apparently. I&nbsp;think I’ll stick to&nbsp;bee honey for now, though.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c76/f02/751d1859c289a27c7969adb679.png><p>If&nbsp;you love coffee and <a href=# title=tea data-link=tag>tea</a>, you’re consuming more than your fair share of&nbsp;bug parts&nbsp;— namely, over 100,000 of&nbsp;them! There are more bugs in&nbsp;our pantries than in&nbsp;any of&nbsp;the food we&nbsp;bring home from the supermarket. These little insects will overtake your supplies of&nbsp;flour and <a href=# title=pasta data-link=tag>pasta</a> very quickly if&nbsp;not stored properly, but before you notice them, you will have eaten them!</p><p>Every packet of&nbsp;flour or&nbsp;spices contains bits of&nbsp;insects as&nbsp;well, which makes our cakes and food taste just that little bit nicer, doesn’t it? Ground pepper is&nbsp;used daily with cooking and more insects are found here than in&nbsp;any other spices! There can be&nbsp;over 400 pieces in&nbsp;2&nbsp;oz, so&nbsp;this must be&nbsp;the secret ingredient to&nbsp;a&nbsp;good meal! [2&nbsp;oz (50&nbsp;g)]</p><p>Having one cup of&nbsp;raisins adds to&nbsp;your daily intake of&nbsp;protein with fruit fly eggs and as&nbsp;many 10&nbsp;whole critters dried as&nbsp;well! Getting hungry yet? We&nbsp;can consume up&nbsp;to&nbsp;2&nbsp;lb [2&nbsp;lb (~1&nbsp;kg)] of&nbsp;insects a&nbsp;year without even knowing&nbsp;it! That’s nearly the same as&nbsp;20*&nbsp;golf balls eaten every single year. That’s a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;trips to&nbsp;the golf course!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/942/f85/3dff2055e1a9a383e544b795a8.png><p>Even chocolate isn’t safe! Chocolate is&nbsp;filled with insects. It&nbsp;only officially becomes a&nbsp;problem if&nbsp;the chocolate has over 60&nbsp;insect pieces per 3.5&nbsp;oz, [3.5&nbsp;oz (100&nbsp;g)] which isn’t as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;you think!</p><p>Cockroaches and moths make up&nbsp;a&nbsp;tiny portion of&nbsp;our treats, and it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;the secret ingredient that makes chocolate so&nbsp;satisfying! Are those peanuts or&nbsp;legs? Mmm!</p><p>Anyone that has chocolate allergies can now be&nbsp;slightly relieved! According to&nbsp;testing, a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people aren’t allergic to&nbsp;cocoa, it’s the ground up&nbsp;cockroach that causes these allergies, and chocolate isn’t the only enjoyable treat affected. Cockroach pieces have been found in&nbsp;peanut butter and cheese as&nbsp;well! So&nbsp;maybe that wasn’t just crunchy peanut butter after all.</p><p>To&nbsp;help the problem, companies are making chocolate covered crickets, ants, and bees! Creating a&nbsp;new delicacy around the world. The taste is&nbsp;like crispy rice and slightly nutty. Chocolate mealworm cookies anyone? During the 19th century, the now-extinct Rocky Mountain locusts destroyed the farmlands of&nbsp;the USA. These swarms could weigh up&nbsp;to&nbsp;27&nbsp;million tons and contain over 12&nbsp;trillion insects!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/438/61e/f5e3ff5f91870180cbdbb911e3.png><p>This would be&nbsp;the same amount of&nbsp;protein as&nbsp;40&nbsp;million cows, or&nbsp;just under half the number of&nbsp;cows in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US now. Jeez, that’s a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;locust burgers!</p><p>Guinness World Records has these swarms as&nbsp;the biggest concentration of&nbsp;animals ever. Something that will be&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;beat, I&nbsp;feel sorry for the person that had to&nbsp;count all the locusts.</p><p>With nearly 2,000 varieties of&nbsp;insects available to&nbsp;eat, it’s not really a&nbsp;question of&nbsp;when you’re going to&nbsp;eat some, it’s how! They’re rich in&nbsp;protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;should be&nbsp;eating more of&nbsp;them, in&nbsp;fact.</p><p>Scientists believe that bugs will become part of&nbsp;the new normal diet in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few years. It&nbsp;turns out eating insects could be&nbsp;way more beneficial for the planet than creating agricultural farms. These pests are actually becoming more popular around the world now, with many restaurants offering crispy crickets as&nbsp;appetizers! If&nbsp;we’re already munching on&nbsp;them daily, that shouldn’t be&nbsp;a&nbsp;hard thing to&nbsp;move into.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ab3/284/67572e5160a8ed69fe013d1830.png><p>Cockroach tacos with a&nbsp;side of&nbsp;crunchy mealworms could be&nbsp;something our kids could be&nbsp;ordering at&nbsp;their favorite restaurants, and we&nbsp;would be&nbsp;the weird ones to&nbsp;them. “What do&nbsp;you mean you ate cows? That’s strange, Mom.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL22wIysq6uZp5eys77InqpmoZ5iwKK402aumqyVp3q0scRmrqGZpGK1orzPnqWsZZ6axbV5l2prbWhoZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
