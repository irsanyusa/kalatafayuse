After whirling on the water.</p><p>When Olofin returned to Iddo to meet his group, it is said that they’d asked him where the plate was. And in answering, he said, "Awo Ti Ri" meaning "The plate has sunk". This is how the name Awori is said to have come into being.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The Awori is a tribe of the Yoruba people speaking a distinct dialect of the Yoruba language.
