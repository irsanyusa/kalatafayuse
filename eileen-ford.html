In 1946, however, she and her husband Jerry established Ford Models. The agency started small but quickly grew in size and prominence.</p><p>Known for her strict rules, Ford often housed young models in her home to guide their careers. She represented many famous models, including Jean Patchett and Suzy Parker. In the 1980s, she worked with <a href=#>Christy Turlington</a>, who lived in Ford's townhouse at age 16.</p><p>Ford expanded her agency internationally, partnering with Dorian Leigh to open branches in Europe. In the 1970s, she faced competition from John Casablancas' Elite agency, leading to legal disputes and model poaching between the agencies.</p><p>To discover new talent, Ford created the "Face of the 80s" competition in 1981. This contest later became known as Ford Models Supermodel of the World. She also shared her industry knowledge through writing, publishing "Eileen Ford's Book of Model Beauty" (1968).</p><p>Ford's influence extended beyond discovering talent. She helped professionalize the modeling industry, setting standards for model behavior and compensation. Her agency played a significant role in establishing the field and making modeling a lucrative career.</p><p>In 1995, Ford retired and handed control of the agency to her daughter Katie. She subsequently passed away in 2014 at the age of 92.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>March 25</a>, <a href=#>1922</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Manhattan, New York, USA</p><p class=info><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Greatest Generation</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Dog</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Aries</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>July 9</a>, <a href=#>2014</a> (aged 92)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> Complications of meningioma and osteoporosis</p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Personal Life</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1944-11-20</a> Model agency executive Eileen Ottensoser (22) weds businessman Gerard W.
