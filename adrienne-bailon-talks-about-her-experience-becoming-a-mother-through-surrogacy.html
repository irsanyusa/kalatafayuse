While many new parents enjoy gushing over their baby, Bailon’s happiness is the result of years of pain and struggles.</p><p>“I think for such a long time it was a quiet journey I had with just myself,” Bailon said. “I didn’t expect it would be so hard for me to have a child, I don’t think women really talk about fertility issues.”</p><p>She only had one embryo left after eight failed IVF rounds over a five-year period. She had to choose to carry the last one herself, which had previously led to several losses, or to use a surrogate. Bailon and her husband welcomed their first son, Ever James, via surrogate in August 2022.</p><p>Despite the fact that it’s not the way she wanted to welcome her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first child</a>, Bailon has since come to terms with the method they used. She became overjoyed at the fact that having a child was possible, since she had many previous pregnancy complications.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Adrienne Bailon is Planning to Have a Second Child</h2><p>Even after welcoming her first child via surrogate, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bailon</a> is feeling hopeful she will get to experience pregnancy for herself. Bailon explained that she plans to give her son a younger sibling, without the need of a surrogate next time.</p><p>“I still do have a dream of maternity photos and what that feels like,” Bailon said. “I want to experience that and I haven’t given up hope, I say I’m either like literally the most delusional person or the most hopeful human being.”</p><p>Today, Bailon is enjoying life as a new parent so much that she purchased a second phone only to shoot photographs of her kid. She also enjoys congratulating him on his small achievements, such as uttering quite distinctive words. Her first child may not have been the pregnancy she hoped it would be, but she remains positive about having another.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_RuPaulsDragRace_EarlyRelease_Screenshot-220x148.jpg alt="‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ Releases The First 5 Minutes of Season 15 – You Don’t Want to Miss This" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wJ2pop2eo7JursCio6imXamurbfSZpibp6Wpeqmx0WacsaiVp7amusKeZJudk6S6qrrGZphmpZ%2Bptaa%2BjK2fq6elnLVuv9SrqaifkZjGcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
