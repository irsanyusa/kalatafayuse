DiCaprio always wanted to become an actor.

They took him to&nbsp;museums, introduced him to&nbsp;<a href=# title=art data-link=tag>art</a>, read books, and exposed him to&nbsp;different cultures. His mom would drive 2&nbsp;hours to&nbsp;take him to&nbsp;University Elementary School, and his father would pick him&nbsp;up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c6f/a42/4be0405583ac9103573cee6d04.jpg><p>Supplied by Capital Pictures/EAST NEWS</p><p>School, though, never became DiCaprio’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thing</a>, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;found it&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;concentrate on&nbsp;things he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;learn. So&nbsp;every school break and free time he&nbsp;had, he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;do&nbsp;improv and break-dancing skits.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;had his first acting gig at&nbsp;age&nbsp;5, but, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;seems, it&nbsp;was too early for him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/85e/ec9/03d1b35fab80393c5d91d48e04.jpg><p>Shooting Star/Sipa USA/East News</p><p>DiCaprio’s mom managed to&nbsp;get him on&nbsp;the TV&nbsp;Show, <i>Romper Room</i>. However, this experience might not have come at&nbsp;the right time for him, as&nbsp;they couldn’t control his behavior on&nbsp;set. He&nbsp;would smack the camera and jump around to&nbsp;do&nbsp;his little flips and routines.</p><p><h2>At&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age, DiCaprio had to&nbsp;face lots of&nbsp;rejection.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/198/943/675bce5612acbf636d0efda7ed.jpg><p>EVERETT COLLECTION/EAST NEWS</p><p>One of&nbsp;the first obstacles DiCaprio had to&nbsp;face was finding an&nbsp;agent. One even suggested changing his name to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Lenny Williams,</a> as&nbsp;it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;easier for him to&nbsp;land a&nbsp;job since it&nbsp;would appeal more to&nbsp;the American audience. He&nbsp;even attended <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>100 auditions</a> without landing a&nbsp;single role.</p><p>During one of&nbsp;his auditions, when DiCaprio was about 10&nbsp;years old, they brought 5&nbsp;kids in&nbsp;to&nbsp;see their looks and whether or&nbsp;not they would be&nbsp;right for acting. “It&nbsp;felt like we&nbsp;were a&nbsp;row of&nbsp;meat. The lady looked at&nbsp;me&nbsp;and at&nbsp;the other kids, saying, ’Not him, not him, not him. You stay.’ I&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;the ’not him,’” the actor revealed in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>. “On&nbsp;the way home in&nbsp;the car, I&nbsp;cried and said, ’Dad, I&nbsp;really want to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;actor, but if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;what it’s about, I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it.’”</p><p>Thankfully, at&nbsp;that moment, his dad was very supportive, and he&nbsp;encouraged him to&nbsp;never give&nbsp;up.<br></p><p><h2>Motivation from his father and the need to&nbsp;financially support his mother made him eager to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;audition.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d22/dcf/47d97e5e62ba3816613744e7bc.jpg><p>Anthony Behar/Sipa USA/East News</p><p>When he&nbsp;finally found a&nbsp;talent <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>agent</a> that accepted him, he&nbsp;secured roles in&nbsp;around 20&nbsp;commercials. In&nbsp;the early 1990s, DiCaprio started acting on&nbsp;television regularly. He&nbsp;started with a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Outsiders</i></a> and a&nbsp;small one in&nbsp;an&nbsp;episode of&nbsp;the soap opera, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Santa Barbara</i></a><i>. </i>His next role in&nbsp;<i>Parenthood</i> in&nbsp;1990 improved his career prospects significantly, and that year he&nbsp;earned 2&nbsp;nominations at&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>12th Youth in&nbsp;Film Awards</a> for Best Young Actor in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Daytime Series for <i>Santa Barbara</i> and Best Young Actor Starring in&nbsp;a&nbsp;New Television Series for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Parenthood</i></a>.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;continued acting in&nbsp;movies in&nbsp;different genres, which helped him sharpen his acting skills and become the star he&nbsp;is&nbsp;today.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/487/0e1/258da05f4797f944e48b0fa933.jpg><p>DiCaprio has picked diverse roles, unlike other actors who only prefer to&nbsp;stick to&nbsp;one niche. “I&nbsp;think actors make the mistake of&nbsp;finding their little niche in&nbsp;the business and once they try to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something a&nbsp;little darker, boom, they get slapped across the face for&nbsp;it, so&nbsp;they go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;what they did before. That’s why the business can be&nbsp;cruel because it&nbsp;doesn’t encourage you to&nbsp;learn,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>.</p><p>And while DiCaprio didn’t feel any pressure from the public to&nbsp;prove his talent before, after <a href=# title=filming data-link=tag>filming</a> <i>What’s Eating Gilbert Grape? </i>he&nbsp;felt that he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;show off what he&nbsp;could&nbsp;do. And when an&nbsp;interviewer asked him if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was scared he&nbsp;couldn’t act so&nbsp;well, again, he&nbsp;said, “No, I&nbsp;know&nbsp;I can do&nbsp;it. It’s something that’s there. But at&nbsp;the same time, you fight off these other things that you’ve started to&nbsp;hear about yourself and that you’re a&nbsp;lot more conscious of&nbsp;than before.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f2/78c/c8ba5c5799ae1abf3e4df9ec5a.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p><h2>Today, DiCaprio is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most popular, beloved actors in&nbsp;the world.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/759/f78/5f0bde5c2b92b53d369d9b5188.jpg><p>RL/REPORTER/East News</p><p>Known for his work as&nbsp;a&nbsp;leading man in&nbsp;period films and biopics, DiCaprio has received many accolades, including a&nbsp;British Academy Film Award, an&nbsp;Academy Award, and 3&nbsp;Golden Globe Awards.

In&nbsp;one interview, he&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;was too busy focusing on&nbsp;his career to&nbsp;think about starting a&nbsp;family. And he&nbsp;expressed to&nbsp;the public that he&nbsp;doesn’t believe in&nbsp;marriage. But later, he&nbsp;consciously contradicted himself and said that he&nbsp;really wants to&nbsp;get married and have children.</p><p>“What I&nbsp;definitely feel a&nbsp;need for is&nbsp;to&nbsp;make my&nbsp;life about more than just my&nbsp;career. Just last night, I&nbsp;was thinking to&nbsp;myself how little of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life has been lived normally and not spent on&nbsp;some far-off movie location,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>. He&nbsp;always felt that a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;him had too many professional plans to&nbsp;even consider starting a&nbsp;family, and the other part of&nbsp;him felt that the idea of&nbsp;having children wasn’t too far-fetched.</p><p>“In&nbsp;this business, nothing is&nbsp;as&nbsp;dangerous and as&nbsp;feared as&nbsp;loneliness. You shoot films in&nbsp;the most remote areas of&nbsp;the world, you’re separated from your family and your friends. And at&nbsp;some point, you’re in&nbsp;your hotel room looking at&nbsp;yourself in&nbsp;the mirror and you realize how lonely you are and how far you are from leading a&nbsp;normal life. That is&nbsp;quite a&nbsp;punch in&nbsp;the gut,” DiCaprio <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>.</p><p>We&nbsp;hope Leonardo DiCaprio finds his happiness, whatever that might&nbsp;be, whether it’s in&nbsp;his career or&nbsp;in&nbsp;starting a&nbsp;family. After learning about what he&nbsp;has to&nbsp;say on&nbsp;the topic, what do&nbsp;you think he&nbsp;wants from life?</p><p><a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, a&nbsp;Hollywood stalwart, has had a&nbsp;career filled with intriguing details. From being named after the Renaissance genius, Leonardo da&nbsp;Vinci, due to&nbsp;his mother’s experience in&nbsp;the Uffizi museum, to&nbsp;facing challenges with his unique name in&nbsp;the early days of&nbsp;his career. DiCaprio has also been open about his struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder, showcasing his resilience. His commitment to&nbsp;the environment is&nbsp;evident, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;once bought an&nbsp;island with plans for an&nbsp;eco-friendly resort. His compassionate side shines through as&nbsp;he&nbsp;adopted a&nbsp;South African girl from a&nbsp;distance, supporting her financially. Despite his numerous accolades, he&nbsp;once won a&nbsp;Razzie for “Worst Actor.” His personal life has also been under the spotlight, especially his dating history. Notably, he&nbsp;and Kate Winslet assisted the last living Titanic survivor, ensuring she didn’t have to&nbsp;sell her cherished mementos.</p><p>The bond between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, which began on&nbsp;the Titanic, has stood the test of&nbsp;time. Their <a href=#>deep connection</a> was evident when they reunited on&nbsp;screen for the intense drama, “Revolutionary Road.” DiCaprio leveraged their friendship to&nbsp;enhance their performances, with Winslet echoing the sentiment, stating that working with DiCaprio felt special. Their bond is&nbsp;so&nbsp;profound that Winslet candidly remarked that DiCaprio feels more like her husband than her real one, emphasizing the significant impact he’s had on&nbsp;her life.</p><p>Kate Winslet’s relationship with Leonardo DiCaprio is&nbsp;a&nbsp;blend of&nbsp;deep friendship and professional respect. Their bond, evident in&nbsp;multiple iconic films, has been a&nbsp;cornerstone for their <a href=#>on-screen chemistry</a>. However, filming intimate scenes for “Revolutionary Road” posed a&nbsp;challenge for Winslet, especially with the film being directed by&nbsp;her then-husband, Sam Mendes. Despite the awkwardness, both actors delivered powerful performances, with DiCaprio seeing their bond as&nbsp;a&nbsp;driving force behind their emotive portrayals.</p><p>Preview photo credit Shooting Star/Sipa USA/East News<span>, </span>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ylnKimkaexsHnDopqaqKKevG6uxJyYpp1dqbWmedKtmKtlmJp6qr%2BMraadmalirq%2BwjLCfmqxdnbJuv8Cim2aZkqTCtXnGnqutoZ6ceq6t0augnpxdlrulecearaKml2KwqbXLnamepl1tfXqBkm9m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
