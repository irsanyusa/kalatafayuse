If you say the phrase ‘uh oh’, the little hiccup noise after the first ‘uh’ is a glottal stop. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Many languages</a> use this sound, including Hebrew, Thai, Tagalog, Danish and Czech. In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a>, the amount of glottal stops in someone’s speech depends heavily on where they’re from, and can be a marker of socio-economic class.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-is-happening-when-you-make-a-glottal-stop?>What is happening when you make a glottal stop?</h2><p>Your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vocal cords or folds</a> are made of smooth muscle. If you put your hand on your throat while speaking, you can feel the vibration of these vocal cords as air moves past them. We change the shape of these bands of muscle to make different sounds. When you ‘lose your voice’ when you’re sick, it’s your vocal cords becoming inflamed and struggling to move that causes it. When we make the glottal stop, our vocal cords nearly block all air entirely, so it stops the sound, and then pop open again. This sound often occurs when a speaker is pronouncing consonants followed by another vowel sound, like in butter or water. The vowel sound can be in the following word as well.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Which-English-dialects-use-the-glottal-stop?>Which English dialects use the glottal stop?</h2><p>Most English speakers will put it in there occasionally, but some use it much more often than others.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>American English</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American English</a> speakers don’t use the glottal stop often, and if you ask an American English speaker they will probably tell you they don’t use it at all! However, you can hear it in words that end in ‘ten’, like kitten, mitten, and bitten. It’s pretty subtle, and you won’t hear it in words that end in ‘den’, like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eden or hidden</a>. It’s not a major feature of American regional accents, and while it can sometimes be associated with class, it’s not as much of a social marker as it is in Britain.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>British English</h3><p>British English and Australian speakers use the glottal stop much more often, and across more sounds, including at the beginning of some words. It’s generally considered a lower-class speech pattern, and it’s a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">point of discussion</a> when politicians litter their speech with it. Probably the most famous of these glottal-stop laden dialects would be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cockney</a>. A dialect associated with the predominantly working class east end of London, Cockney is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">full of glottal stops</a>. This kind of accent was discouraged for many years, and not represented in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">film or television</a>. You can hear a cleaned-up version in <a href=#>Michae</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">l</a><a href=#> Caine’s Alfie</a> from 1966. For most people, a Cockney accent is the best example of a glottal stop in action.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Should I try to imitate the glottal stop in English?</h2><p>That’s a good question. In American English, most people won’t notice if you use a glottal stop or not, and it won’t make it difficult to understand you. Some people will even appreciate your clear pronunciation of words like bitten and mitten. In British English it gets a bit more challenging to explain. Accents and dialects in Britain are heavily entangled in the class system, and whether people admit it or not, judgements are made based on your accent. Most native British English speakers <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would not be impressed</a> by an attempt at a Cockney accent, and people from the east end would likely take offense, so it’s best not to try and incorporate too many glottal stops into your speech. Ideally, aim for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RP</a>, Received Pronunciation, sometimes described as ‘BBC English’, if you’re learning British English.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Glottal stops are complicated</h2><p>There are some elements of learning a language, like getting the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">grammar</a> right and using <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slang</a>, that make you sound more like a native speaker. Dropping in glottal stops is not really necessary, however, and when it goes wrong, it may insult someone depending on where you are. After living and working with native speakers for a while, you might find yourself making glottal stops unconsciously. Just don’t force it!&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Erin-2-2.jpeg><h2>Erin McGann</h2><p>Erin McGann is a Canadian freelance writer focusing on travel, living abroad, parenting, history, and culture.
