After losing the love of&nbsp;her life at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;30, Streep fell in&nbsp;love again and has been with her current husband for more than 40&nbsp;years.</p><p>Meryl Streep met John Cazale in&nbsp;1976, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;27, while acting in&nbsp;an&nbsp;adaptation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=Shakespeare data-link=tag>Shakespeare</a> play. He&nbsp;was 14&nbsp;years older than her and was an&nbsp;actor who was recognized and respected by&nbsp;his peers&nbsp;— most famous for his role in&nbsp;<i>The Godfather</i>. They became a&nbsp;couple soon afterward.</p><p>When they began filming <i>Deer Hunter</i> in&nbsp;1977, Cazale noticed something was wrong. After a&nbsp;consultation and many tests, the diagnosis was devastating: John only had a&nbsp;few months to&nbsp;live.</p><p>Meryl accepted a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;the series <i>Holocaust</i> in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;pay for treatment and help her boyfriend, and received help from 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;his great friends: Robert De&nbsp;Niro and Al&nbsp;<a href=# title=Pacino data-link=tag>Pacino</a>. Al&nbsp;Pacino took care of&nbsp;him while Meryl was filming in&nbsp;Europe. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> of&nbsp;his friend: “I&nbsp;learned about acting from him more than from anyone else. All I&nbsp;wanted was to&nbsp;work with John for the rest of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/122/f00/18ddb456bb91567e6b04381d44.jpg><p>Meryl accompanied him in&nbsp;the hospital until, in&nbsp;March 1978, the doctor told Meryl that John had passed away. She, in&nbsp;shock, collapsed on&nbsp;his chest, begging him to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wake</a>&nbsp;up. For a&nbsp;second, Cazale opened his eyes and assured Meryl that she was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fine, and then finally closed his eyes.</p><p>In&nbsp;the midst of&nbsp;her grief, Meryl was evicted from her apartment. Her brother, who was concerned that Meryl <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>couldn’t handle</a> the pain while making the move, offered to&nbsp;help. That’s when everything changed for the actress because her brother arrived accompanied by&nbsp;his friend Don.</p><p>Don Gummer was born in&nbsp;1946. Both he&nbsp;and Meryl attended Yale, and Gummer also graduated from the School of&nbsp;Fine <a href=# title=Arts data-link=tag>Arts</a>. By&nbsp;the mid-1980s, Don was already a&nbsp;prestigious sculptor whose work was exhibited around the world with many, many awards and accolades.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af1/314/c488295d868e6b08e12dbc6787.jpg><p>When Don found out that Meryl was being evicted, he&nbsp;offered her to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>move</a> into his loft, since he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;going on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip and the place would be&nbsp;empty. They kept in&nbsp;touch through letters, but then she began to&nbsp;suspect that he&nbsp;wanted more than to&nbsp;just be&nbsp;friends.</p><p>6&nbsp;months later, Meryl and Don were married in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small ceremony in&nbsp;the garden of&nbsp;her parents’ home in&nbsp;late 1978. To&nbsp;her mother’s criticism, concerned about the haste of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, Meryl replied, “I&nbsp;haven’t gotten over John’s death, but&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;living and Don taught me&nbsp;how to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/86c/2b9/638aed5ea480a3ceb53a6692a9.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the following year, their first son, Henry, was born. Then came 2&nbsp;daughters, Mamie and Grace, and in&nbsp;1991 they had their fourth and last child, Louise. Beyond that, Meryl never wanted to&nbsp;expose her children to&nbsp;the press, even though most have chosen artistic careers: 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;her daughters are actresses and her son is&nbsp;a&nbsp;musician.</p><p>“They were my&nbsp;oasis. I&nbsp;took great pleasure in&nbsp;watching my&nbsp;children grow&nbsp;up, being their confidant, and enjoying everything that went along with helping them become independent young people,” Meryl <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. The actress always spoke well of&nbsp;her husband, how he&nbsp;took care of&nbsp;her children when she was away filming, but never made her feel guilty of&nbsp;her absence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/059/d3d/7b9ebf5967908d32401f989780.jpg><p>Once their children left home, Meryl and Don moved to&nbsp;New York. Neither Don nor Meryl are usually in&nbsp;the news, but he&nbsp;always accompanies her to&nbsp;every award show, and we&nbsp;see him at&nbsp;practically every awards ceremony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ffb/4f8/e0a7f15da48cbe0caa8092639d.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2012, when Meryl won the Best Actress Oscar for her role in&nbsp;<i>Julie &&nbsp;Julia</i>, the actress began her acceptance speech by&nbsp;naming her husband.</p><p>“First, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thank</a> Don because, when you thank your husband at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the speech, they always play music for you to&nbsp;finish. And I&nbsp;want you to&nbsp;know that everything most precious in&nbsp;our lives has been given to&nbsp;me&nbsp;by&nbsp;you,” Meryl said in&nbsp;her speech, her voice breaking.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/56d/d95/766d1e5e52b25822c0cf9e1ed5.jpg><p>The couple has been married for more than 40&nbsp;years. Meryl has never explicitly talked about having problems in&nbsp;their marriage, but she has implied that they overcame them. She has confessed that she believes that, to&nbsp;keep the marriage strong, the secret is&nbsp;to&nbsp;talk about any problems that may arise, even if&nbsp;it’s something small. “You <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>have</a> to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;your partner’s problems, suggestions, and advice and accept that you are not always right. Conversation is&nbsp;the key to&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful marriage.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc5/568/3a7bb25ccca878bb0cf2a49b26.jpg><p>Don has been asked if&nbsp;he&nbsp;realizes he&nbsp;is&nbsp;married to&nbsp;the most acclaimed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actress</a> of&nbsp;his generation, but he&nbsp;has said he&nbsp;never thinks about&nbsp;it. At&nbsp;home, the Hollywood glamour disappears, and they simply argue about whether to&nbsp;wash the dishes by&nbsp;hand or&nbsp;put them in&nbsp;the dishwasher.</p><p>How do&nbsp;you think it&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;overcome the death of&nbsp;a&nbsp;loved one?
