Andrew Greene, who worked at Stratton Oakmont from 1993 to 1996, says his full legal name was used in Jordan Belfort’s memoir that inspired the film. And though his name is changed in the movie, he says he did not agree to the libelous characterization and has filed a suit against Paramount Pictures, Red Granite Pictures, and other producers of the film, the Hollywood Reporter reports."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Byrne —&nbsp;has a small part in the film. He wears a toupée throughout the movie and is one of the executives at the corrupt brokerage firm founded by Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio). Nonetheless, Greene is none-too-happy with the character.</p><p>“The motion picture contains various scenes wherein Mr. Greene’s character is portrayed as a criminal, drug user, degenerate, depraved and/or devoid of any morality or ethics,” <a href=#>says the lawsuit</a>. “In one scene, Mr. Greene’s character is depicted shaving a woman’s head after Jordan Belfort’s character states the woman was offered ten thousand dollars.”</p><p>Greene claims that he did not agree to his likeness being used in the movie, and that the film makes libelous statements that could damage his reputation by portraying him as a “criminal and drug user with misogynistic tendencies.” In the movie, Koskoff has sex with a prostitute, helps Jordan Belfort in his plot to launder money and does cocaine on company property.</p><p>The Hollywood Reporter <a href=#>said</a> that Paramount referred questions to Red Granite, which didn’t immediately comment on the lawsuit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidnqmys8DAoqWmnZ6pe7W1zJ5lnKedZH9xfZNoZ2tnYW58uLvLn2Sonl2srq24jKyrq52VqXq0wNSdoKhlo6qypXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
