Sunak has been Prime Minister since October 2022 and is married to Akshata Murty, who comes from a wealthy family in India.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Murty’s father, N.R. Narayana Murthy, is worth approximately $4.7 billion <a href=#>according to Forbes</a>, making him the 669th richest person in the world, per the publication’s real-time estimations on July 4. His wealth comes from his role as co-founder of the Indian tech company <a href=#>Infosys</a>, which provides business consulting and information technology services.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sunak himself is also a high earner, having started his career as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs. According to his most recent tax return, <a href=#>he made approximately $2.8 million</a> (£2.2 million) in the tax year of 2022 to 2023, though this represents just a small fraction of the couple’s total net worth.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Together, Sunak and his wife are worth approximately $830 million (£651 million), according to <a href=#>The Sunday Times' 2024 Rich List</a>. This makes them the 245th richest family in the U.K. and Sunak the wealthiest person to ever become Prime Minister of the country. The couple ranked even higher than King Charles III, who <a href=#>was listed 258th on the list</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The couple previously came under criticism for <a href=#>Murty’s status as a non-domicile</a> of the U.K., which meant that she was not required to pay U.K. taxes on the income she made outside of Britain, including the shares she owns of her father’s business. However, amid public criticism in April 2022, it was reported that <a href=#>Murty had announced she would pay U.K. tax</a> on overseas income.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWlqfXl%2FjqugrKCZYsC2usCkZLChlpp6orfSoZitmV2iwrPA2GalnqxdrLyzwMdmnKysmaKutbXOp6po</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
