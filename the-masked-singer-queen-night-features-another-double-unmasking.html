It was the Group A Finals, as Goldfish was declared the champion. That meant that both Ugly Sweater and Starfish had to be unmasked.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ugly-sweater-starfish-unmasked-on-the-masked-singer>Ugly Sweater, Starfish Unmasked on The Masked Singer</h2><p>During Wednesday’s episode, Ugly Sweater performed Queen’s “I Want to Break Free,” impressing the panel. However, it unfortunately wasn’t enough to take him to the next round. He was announced as the first contestant to be unmasked.</p><p>Final guesses from the panel about Ugly Sweater’s identity included Aaron Neville, Smokey Robinson, and Al Green. However, only Robin Thicke was correct in guessing that it was Charlie Wilson of the Gap Band fame. He said goodbye to the show with a performance of “You Dropped a Bomb on Me.”</p><p>Wednesday’s show also featured another rocking performance from Starfish, who sang “Under Pressure.” She ended up competing in a Battle Royale against Goldfish. They each showed off their own take on “Another One Bites the Dust.”</p><p>Ultimately, Starfish was the one eliminated. Final guesses from the panel about her identity included Kate McKinnon, Amy Schumer, and Lisa Kudrow. However, only Ken Jeong was correct in guessing that Starfish was The Office star Kate Flannery.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE MASKED SINGER’ SEASON 11 CONTINUES WITH TWO UNMASKINGS</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-goldfish-wows-with-emotional-performance>Goldfish Wows with Emotional Performance</h2><p>Goldfish dominated the competition on Wednesday night. Before their performance, they opened up about losing someone important to them the night before a big role. Fittingly, they chose to perform “The Show Must Go On.” The performance made panelist Rita Ora emotional.</p><p>Later in the show, Goldfish went up against Starfish in a very aquatic Battle Royale. Both of them delivered impressive performances in their own individual styles, but it was Goldfish who became the winner of the Group A Finals and earned a spot in the Quarterfinals.</p><p>Goldfish will go up against Clock and Poodle Moth, who made it through the Group C Finals earlier in the season. We have yet to find out who will win the Group B Finals and join those three contestants for another chance to make it all the way to the end.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Original_HeidiKlum_SofiaVergara_Trae-Patton_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Heidi Klum, Sofia Vergara Rumored to Not Get Along on ‘America’s Got Talent’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWRqLimsIysoKeflad6ssHEnqVmppmctbV5xZ6Yra2imsBurc2oq6GdomKxsMHBpZxmrZ6irrS3yKeeaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
