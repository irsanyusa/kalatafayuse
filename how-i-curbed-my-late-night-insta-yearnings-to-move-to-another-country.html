There’s a subway line in New York that starts on Hillside Avenue in the borough of Queens, just a couple of minutes from Donald Trump’s childhood home.

It crosses over to Manhattan by way of Central Park South, down to fancy SoHo, and then on to Brooklyn, where it heads south for dozens of stops that have names like Kings Highway, Avenue X, and Neptune Avenue. The last one is Coney Island where you exit the station onto Mermaid Avenue, which, like the rest of the city, is part whimsy, part grit.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Want more inspiration?

(This means you can find <a href=# rel=noopener>Korean-Uzbek restaurants</a> alongside traditional Kosher spots.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Brighton Beach boardwalk isn’t just a different America, it feels like a different decade. This city doesn’t just span neighborhoods, it somehow crosses time, space, and language continuums.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are a few sprawling traditional restaurants like <a href=# rel=noopener>Tatiana</a> serving caviar and crepes. But no Starbucks or Shake Shack or fried dough. Older Russian-speaking women sail by in little groups wearing bright clothes and coordinated jewelry. They take these post-prandial walks along the sea with their small grandchildren trailing behind, switching between Brooklyn Russian and English. The beauty of it all is that they are not going anywhere; they’re just strolling. On a weekday! It’s unsettling for those of us from the more frantic bits of the city.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This little excursion was an attempt to get out of my usual five block radius, and to kick a habit I like to call “find another life scrolling” which involves me sifting through global travel sites late at night, coveting lives I haven’t gotten to live in countries where I don’t speak the language. Never mind that there’s still a pandemic out there, and I’m still paying college tuition for two kids; I’ll use the hours between midnight and 2 am to figure out whether my dog would have to go into quarantine if I moved to Morocco for a year.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Sometimes I convince myself</strong> that this late-night travel scrolling is a visualization practice that will manifest in reality. But mostly, this fantasizing about other places to be, other ways to live, cultivates dissatisfaction.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And maybe there’s no better cure for that kind of FOMO than to visit with people who chose my city as their escape. Not from white-collar ennui or the <a href=# rel=noopener>languishing</a> we all keep fretting about, but from more significant challenges.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I met a young Kazakh man who emigrated to Brighton Beach as a teen and I asked whether he was happy here. For happiness, he said, you need your family. And it helps if you can earn enough to live and the freedom to live where you want. He said he had all those things. But I wondered, don’t you yearn for a less stressful, less expensive place to live than this chaotic city? He said, yes, it costs a lot for not much here, and he’d left this community to live in another state. “I felt like an immigrant there,” he said. “When I came back here from the airport, this felt like home.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It is maybe the ultimate gift to be at home and an immigrant at the same time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Want more inspiration?
