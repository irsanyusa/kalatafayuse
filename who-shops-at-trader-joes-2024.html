But who are the customers that can’t stop frequenting the grocer that’s been around since 1967.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">By digging into Morning Consult Audience, which draws on millions of survey interviews about demographics, psychographics, and user habits collected every day in more than 40 countries, we’re able to paint a better picture of exactly who is flocking to Trader Joe’s, and making their products go viral.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Frequent Trader Joe’s shoppers are more likely to be young, male and well off than the general public</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">This cohort, defined as those who shop at Trader Joe’s at least weekly, is young. They’re 7 percentage points more likely to be Gen Zers and 11 percentage points more likely to be millennials than the general population.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">And while women tend to do more grocery shopping for their household than men, it’s men that are repeating Trader Joe’s customers. Men are 20 points more likely than women to say they shop at Trader Joe’s at least weekly (60% vs. 40%, respectively).&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">They’re also more likely to be high earners than the general population. A quarter of frequent Trader Joe’s shoppers belong to a household that makes over $100,000 annually, 8 points more than the general population. This gap is particularly interesting given Trader Joe’s has developed a reputation for affordable prices. One strategy that helps the company achieve this is not selling name brands, almost all of its inventory is private label goods.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>They’re prolific social media users</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Trader Joe’s has also developed quite the reputation for social media virality, with a recent example being the coveted mini-tote bag. The $2.99 canvas bags were released last month, quickly went viral and flew off store shelves. Some locations even had to put limits on the number of bags customers could buy. So it makes sense that their most loyal customers are also dedicated social media users — in fact, they over index on usage of all 15 social media platforms we track.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">For example, frequent Trader Joe’s shoppers are 22 points more likely to use Instagram and 19 points more likely to use TikTok than U.S. adults. This could be a reason the brand is often featured by content creators and social media users in short form haul videos, or even private Facebook groups with large followings dedicated to helping busy (or lazy) people make dinner quickly, or sharing favorite products.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>They’re buying groceries online, even though Trader Joe’s doesn’t offer the service</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">And while many grocers have created their own apps and leaned into online grocery orders, Trader Joe’s isn’t one of them. The company doesn’t sell any products online, offer curbside pickup or partner with any third party grocery delivery services. This choice all comes down to the wayTrader Joe’s establishes its <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>own value prop</a>, “We're still just big ‘ole fans of the neighborhood grocery store where we can say hello when you're looking around wondering, ‘what's for dinner?’"&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But that doesn’t mean its most loyal customers don’t want to shop online. In fact, frequent Trader Joe’s shoppers are 18 points more likely to say they buy groceries online compared with the general population. This could mean they’re buying different types of products from other grocers than Trader Joe’s, and if the company were to ever change its stance, it would be welcome from those that already frequent their brick and mortar stores.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Frequent Trader Joe’s shoppers are trend seekers</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Trader Joe’s devotees are adventurous. That means they’re more likely than the general population to seek out the latest trends (56% vs. 31%, respectively) and act as first adopters of new technology (53% vs. 29%, respectively). This tendency aligns well with some of the new and seasonal offerings the company frequently releases, like the fan favorite Lemon Mini Sheet Cake returning this spring.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But that adventurous streak also brings a loyalty challenge. Frequent Trader Joe’s shoppers were 5 points less likely than the general public to agree with the statement, “When I find a product or service that I like, I stick with it.”&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Despite that, Trader Joe’s has a consistent ability to go viral and stay relevant, even without investing in advertising. Its popularity among a cohort prone towards gushing about their purchases on social media means the brand will stay relevant among a valuable demographic of young consumers that have many years of grocery shopping ahead of them.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><i>Morning Consult Intelligence customers can access the platform </i><a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#><i>here</i></a><i>.
