When Archuleta unmasked himself after hiding his identity as Macaw, judge Ken Jeong was particularly brought to tears. This was apparently because Archuleta’s voice has healed the Jeong family from emotionally tough times since he sang his rendition of “Imagine” by John Lennon.</p><p>“You are a ray of light to me, my wife and to my kids– thank God for you!” Jeong said.</p><p>At the time, Archuleta didn’t hold back and shared his own personal story. The “A Little Too Not Over You” performer admitted that he had thought of suicide before he accepted himself as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">queer</a>. Now, with a stronger and freer perspective on being gay, Archuleta is ready to advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights through music. Recently, the singer dropped the song “Up,” his first ever single unmasked since The Masked Singer.</p><p>“It’s a song about finding the strength you didn’t know you had in you,” he said about the song. “And replacing any fear and hate with love. Especially self-love.”</p><p>According to Archuleta, “Up” is for people who have hit rock bottom and felt hopeless. For the pop singer, getting oneself off the ground and moving up are the only ways through.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-shared-how-he-overcame-the-guilt-of-being-queer>He Shared How He Overcame The Guilt of Being Queer</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Growing up religious</a>, it became an extremely difficult journey for Archuleta to come out as queer. Recounting the experience, the singer stated that he used to look at himself as a failure and a “wicked” person for not overcoming the challenge of same sex attraction.</p><p>“It made me afraid of myself, and I did not want to be a ‘wicked’ person walking the earth,” he<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> said</a>. “No matter how many times I tried, no matter how many times I tried dating a woman, I went to church and fasted, never looked at pornography, and despite that, I realized it was just my nature.”</p><p>Archuleta went on and stated that such fear forced him to hide himself even in the aspect of music. Back then, he would rather drop Christmas albums than songs about his sexuality. He’s released Therapy Sessions before, exposing some of his suppressed thoughts about being part of the queer community.</p><p>Later on, he realized that God didn’t intend him to change, that God meant him to be gay. Consequently, this revelation motivated him to be free and happy with the way the he is and feels.</p><p>“There was an absolute clarity and assurance, absolute confidence, so loving support from a Higher Power greater than me, that showed me how to love greater,” he said. “It taught me to love myself and allow myself to be loved.&nbsp; It was pure, it was healing.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_DemiLovato_Alex-GoodlettGetty-Images-for-Operation-Smile-220x147.jpg alt="Why Demi Lovato Stopped Using They/Them Pronouns Exclusively, Returns to Using She/Her" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>David Archuleta</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qtopxdlr%2BktNSlnK2ZXaeyrbHArJysZZaev7TAjKygp5%2Bcmnq0tc2cnGagmah6q7vUq6WesV2ku27Ax55kppmjoLKledKipaCdomQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
