With Battle Rounds coming to the end soon, coaches are beginning to hit their steal as soon as they can. Here‚Äôs the most intriguing battles from the night.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-team-reba-impresses-in-first-performance-of-the-night>Team Reba Impresses in First Performance of The Night</h2><p>The Voice kicked off with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Reba</a> tonight. The first performance of the episode featured Ruby Leigh and Al Boogie. Since both singers are country/bluegrass artists, McEntire picked ‚ÄúJolene‚Äù by Dolly Parton for them.</p><p>Both singers sang country music in their audition, so this pick makes sense for the artists. If you forgot, Ruby earned a Four-Chair turn, while Al Boogie only turned McEntire‚Äôs chair.</p><p>This was such a good pair that it was hard to determine which singer was pulling ahead. If I had to pick, I‚Äôd say Ruby earned her spot in the Knockout Rounds, since she was channeling all of her emotions while giving this performance. Other coaches more or less agreed with my opinion, noting Ruby‚Äôs emotions, yet always bringing up the counterpoint that Al Boogie wasn‚Äôt given an equal playing field given the way the song was written.</p><p>In the end McEntire picked Ruby as the winner of the battle. Now, Ruby is going into the Knockout Rounds as part of Team Reba.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We can easily understand why Al Boogie and Ruby Leigh are in the battles! üåü <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AM0hn0bjhE</a></p>‚Äî The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 31, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-team-legend-singer-earns-double-steal>Team Legend Singer Earns Double Steal</h2><p>Mid-episode, Team <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Legend</a> stepped up to the plate with a silky smooth rendition of ‚ÄúDo It‚Äù by Chloe x Halle. This battle featured Azan Hysn and Taylor Deneen. If you don‚Äôt remember Azan turned Legend and McEntires‚Äô chairs while Taylor turned Legend and Stefani‚Äôs chairs.</p><p>As soon as this performance began, I knew it would be my favorite of the night. These ladies came to the stage with loads of talent and they weren‚Äôt afraid to show it off.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>That's just how <a href=#>@azanhysn</a> and <a href=#>@itstaylordeneen</a> "Do It" üòé <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XDj03v7czr</a></p>‚Äî The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 31, 2023</a><p>Coaches were unable to pick between the two, since they both came out like it was their own concert. In the end, Legend admitted that it felt like everyone was able to see how much of a natural each women is on stage. The coach picked Taylor as the winner, since she stood out more as a vocalist.</p><p>Luckily, Azan‚Äôs time in the competition isn‚Äôt over yet. Both Niall Horan and McEntire hit their steal buttons for the singer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-team-niall-impresses-with-billie-eilish-cover>Team Niall Impresses With Billie Eilish Cover</h2><p>Eventually, Team Niall members Alexa Wildish and LVNDR took the stage singing their rendition of ‚Äúeverything I wanted‚Äù by Billie Eilish. This rendition was somber, yet light and airy. It truly showed off the vocal abilities of both singers.</p><p>Coaches thought that Alexa shined in this performance and she felt the song more emotionally. Once it was Horan‚Äôs turn to speak, he mentioned that he thought long and hard about this pair ahead of their performance. Horan picked Alexa as the winner of the battle.</p><p>After LVNDR walked off the stage, Legend admitted that he thought about stealing the singer. If she were to have made her portion of the song her own, he would‚Äôve hit the Steal Button for her.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@AlexaWildish</a> and LVNDR dueting is everything we wanted. ‚ú® <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZCd4535aVF</a></p>‚Äî The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 31, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-incredible-olivia-rodrigo-cover-ends-the-show>Incredible Olivia Rodrigo Cover Ends The Show</h2><p>The final performance of the episode was between Team Legend singers Kaylee Shimizu and Elizabeth Evans. Superfans of The Voice were able to watch this Battle <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">early</a>, since it was released early last Friday.</p><p>The artists performed an incredibly-emotional rendition of ‚ÄúTraitor‚Äù by Olivia Rodrigo. Coaches complimented both singers, making it hard to predict which singer Legend would pick as the winner. In the end, the coach decided that Kaylee was the winner of the battle.</p><p>As Elizabeth was walking off stage, McEntire hit her steal for the singer. This prompted the singer to jump up and down in shock. Elizabeth will be continuing into the Knockout Rounds as part of Team Reba.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>The Voice returns to NBC on Tuesday, October 31 at 8 p.m. for a recap of tonight‚Äôs episode.
