It’s really about how happy you are in&nbsp;the place you’ve created. To&nbsp;that end, the elements you have inside, like <a href=# title=furniture data-link=tag>furniture</a> and decor, are critical. But perhaps you’ve seen beautiful boards on&nbsp;Pinterest and gotten frustrated because your home doesn’t look exactly the same.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> likes to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the beautiful side of&nbsp;things and, incidentally, help inspire you to&nbsp;do&nbsp;those projects that could improve your lifestyle and take you to&nbsp;a&nbsp;happier place. That’s why we’ve put together these tips to&nbsp;update your home and make it&nbsp;more pleasing to&nbsp;the eye.</p><p><h2>1. A&nbsp;dark, secluded area</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e4/2a9/1cd6e8551c930e4401636a32ea.jpg><p>The living room is&nbsp;a&nbsp;meeting and gathering space for family and friends. It’s typically one of&nbsp;the rooms that you spend the most time in&nbsp;when you’re socializing with others. That’s why it’s so&nbsp;important for this room which, in&nbsp;the last century, used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;dark and dreary, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;easily accessible and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>inviting</a>.</p><p>Your goal today is&nbsp;to&nbsp;enhance the natural light that your living room has. To&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, you can, for example, remove walls and make a&nbsp;single space with other parts of&nbsp;the house, like the kitchen or&nbsp;the dining room. You can also paint the furniture and walls white to&nbsp;project more light and create a&nbsp;feeling of&nbsp;openness.</p><p><h2>2. Outdated shelves</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/513/43d/d6d6425647a8aef32752c0ac6f.jpg><p>People who like reading regularly may often face problems with space at&nbsp;home. After all, books, bookshelves, and bookcases can take up&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;room. And while we&nbsp;can sometimes convince ourselves that a&nbsp;space will look better with books, that’s not really the case. Using dark wood for your shelves and overcrowding your house with books just makes it&nbsp;look like an&nbsp;old dresser.</p><p>Taking tips from <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Marie Kondo</a>’s method, you may want to&nbsp;pare down your book collection a&nbsp;bit and arrange them according to&nbsp;your priorities. You can start by&nbsp;choosing your favorites. Choose the ones that have left an&nbsp;impression on&nbsp;your life and that you could read a&nbsp;thousand times. Then there are also books you bought but haven’t read, and finally, books you simply don’t want to&nbsp;keep anymore. Take years off your bookshelves by&nbsp;painting them in&nbsp;light or&nbsp;vibrant colors.</p><p><h2>3. Macramé of&nbsp;the last century</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/141/436/5ea8c95dd2a1441547de755e1d.jpg><p>Everybody has one of&nbsp;those macramé hand-knitted decorations at&nbsp;home. While they may have sentimental value for many since they were likely made by&nbsp;your aunt or&nbsp;grandmother, consider that most of&nbsp;these are out of&nbsp;fashion. Not only do&nbsp;they gather dust and detract from the style of&nbsp;a&nbsp;room, but they are also objects with no&nbsp;practical use.</p><p>If&nbsp;you are too sentimental to&nbsp;say goodbye to&nbsp;this type of&nbsp;age-old gift, you could try and find a&nbsp;new function for them. For example, you could use them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;very fancy bedspread or&nbsp;a&nbsp;macramé for hanging <a href=# title=plants data-link=tag>plants</a>, and your home will have a&nbsp;new cool <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>boho-chic style</a>.</p><p><h2>4. Painting the walls in&nbsp;dark or&nbsp;too vibrant colors</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/56f/bfc/36a1125636b33885bde4c46110.jpg><p>Before deciding what color you’ll use to&nbsp;paint the walls, like the ones in&nbsp;your living room, ask yourself the following question: Even if&nbsp;you really like that color, do&nbsp;you think it&nbsp;would look great on&nbsp;all the walls in&nbsp;your living room?</p><p>Painting all the walls with one color makes the whole room look somewhat oppressive because the corners tend to&nbsp;disappear. Plus, you will have to&nbsp;maintain them constantly if&nbsp;cracks appear or&nbsp;if&nbsp;the paint peels off. Instead, go&nbsp;for neutral tones. These will allow light to&nbsp;reflect on&nbsp;things and withstand the test of&nbsp;time.</p><p><h2>5. Old and short curtains</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/09c/0ae/926df65cf58ab7de98a122b7b2.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;give a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>modern feel</a> to&nbsp;your home, choose long curtains. When in&nbsp;doubt, always go&nbsp;for long (even puddled) curtains instead of&nbsp;short ones that are typical of&nbsp;kids’ bedrooms. As&nbsp;we&nbsp;mentioned before, if&nbsp;they drag, it’s even better. Lose your fear of&nbsp;fabric and choose neutral tones that allow light to&nbsp;pass through to&nbsp;brighten up&nbsp;the room and remove a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;“weight” from your <a href=# title="interior decoration" data-link=tag>interior decoration</a>.</p><p><h2>6. Poor artificial lighting</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f46/983/3b76c95ca2b3131a73600af98c.jpg><p>Forget about old overhead light bulbs and go&nbsp;for light that can be&nbsp;projected in&nbsp;different parts of&nbsp;the room. Multiply the sources of&nbsp;light, either by&nbsp;using floor lamps or&nbsp;by&nbsp;installing table lamps here and there. Their main purpose should be&nbsp;to&nbsp;add a&nbsp;special touch or&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>highlight</a> a&nbsp;particular area of&nbsp;the room where you want to&nbsp;draw people’s attention, with a&nbsp;contrast between the lighter and darker aspects of&nbsp;the room.</p><p><h2>7. No&nbsp;natural elements</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e1/598/35885e5870824fa22cf9bc70a8.jpg><p>Having <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>plants</a> at&nbsp;home has become a&nbsp;huge trend among Millenials, and the truth is&nbsp;we&nbsp;should be&nbsp;thankful that’s the case. Not only do&nbsp;they help clean the air in&nbsp;the areas of&nbsp;your home, but they also give them a&nbsp;super trendy green touch, which makes any corner look great. A&nbsp;fresh and modern house should have some plants in&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>8. Not getting rid of&nbsp;imperfections</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/41d/d93/45059459cf847bfae18bf44c56.jpg><p>Stains on&nbsp;the wall, cracks, loose wires, broken sockets, or&nbsp;unpainted walls can not only be&nbsp;dangerous features, structurally speaking, but they also make your home look like a&nbsp;construction site. If&nbsp;you think your home has become outdated or&nbsp;unaesthetic, then consider a&nbsp;<a href=# title=renovation data-link=tag>renovation</a> within your budget. If&nbsp;you’re short on&nbsp;money, you can always spend some time fixing the basic issues yourself unless we’re talking about real damage that should be&nbsp;taken care of&nbsp;by&nbsp;a&nbsp;specialist.</p><p><h2>9. Unproportionate carpets</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/47b/45a/043b2e53d4821b0169dc48a9da.jpg><p>Please say goodbye to&nbsp;carpet stuck to&nbsp;the floor or&nbsp;old, dirty carpeting that came with the house you just bought. Rugs should always be&nbsp;designed according to&nbsp;the layout of&nbsp;the area you want to&nbsp;place them&nbsp;in. Look for inspiration in&nbsp;basic colors that you can combine with other decorative elements within the room, creating a&nbsp;colorful and harmonious environment.</p><p><h2>10. Having too many decorative elements</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dfb/230/3cd0d9528ba9f4b2ebd105310d.jpg><p>Even if&nbsp;you don’t want to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;completely minimalist home, you can make sure to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;all those decorative elements that don’t provide any meaningful insight into you or&nbsp;your state of&nbsp;mind. Stick to&nbsp;what, in&nbsp;simple terms, says, “This is&nbsp;me, and this is&nbsp;my&nbsp;home.” If&nbsp;you are looking to&nbsp;be&nbsp;trendy, always remember to&nbsp;be&nbsp;moderate so&nbsp;that you have enough time to&nbsp;pay attention to&nbsp;detail.</p><p>What elements of&nbsp;your home do&nbsp;you think are tacky or&nbsp;make it&nbsp;look dated? Would you have a&nbsp;hard time getting rid of&nbsp;them? Why?</p><p>Bright Side has its own <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>podcasts</a> now.
