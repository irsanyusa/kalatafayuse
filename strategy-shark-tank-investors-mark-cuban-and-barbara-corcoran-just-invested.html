"I wasn't the best chef ... but one thing I could make was avocado toast," Biggi told Business Insider.</p><p>He called Brachetti, living in Mexico at the time, and within a year the concept of opening "the world's first avocado bar" had turned into a popular restaurant in Brooklyn. The restaurant has been successful since it started in 2017,</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The restaurant is located in the Industry City food hall in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.</p><p>The restaurant itself is pretty small, and it's open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.</p><p>I got to the restaurant around 1 p.m., and the lunch-rush line nearly stretched out the door.</p><p>When I walked into the restaurant, the brightly colored menu was hanging up on the wall, listing salads, sandwiches, soups, and desserts. It also listed products like t-shirts, enamel pins, and an avocado body scrub.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The products listed on the menu are also on display in the back of the restaurant.</p><p>Next to the product display was a small table in the back with plants and a few condiments.</p><p>Also in the back of the store was a cluster of people taking photos of the "smashed in NYC" sign behind the counter. The neon sign and greenery gave the restaurant a nice atmosphere, and definitely made it an Instagram-worthy place to eat.</p><p>Food was served in a fast-casual style, and I waited less than five minutes for my food after I ordered.</p><p>Because there isn't seating in the restaurant, I ordered my food to-go and sat at the communal tables in Industry City, as most Avocaderia customers do.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>I ordered the "chill out" toast, chocolate mousse, and a vanilla-almond smoothie. It came with a side of baked pita chips, and cost about $25.</p><p>On the menu, the "chill out" toast is described as "multigrain bread, avo mash, chili flakes, shichimi and lime citronette." I was surprised when the toast only came with one slice of bread, but it was so flavorful and decadent that it was filling.</p><p>The chocolate mousse, made from avocado, coconut milk, melted chocolate, and agave, was also very rich. The avocado was used for the texture of the mousse, but you could hardly taste it.</p><p>Avocado, dates, almonds, almond milk, vanilla, and agave syrup were used to make the vanilla-almond smoothie, and like the mousse, the avocado was hardly noticeable (besides the green tint). The smoothie tasted like a vanilla milkshake. It also offered "Avo Mango" and "Green Matcha" smoothies.</p><p>After eating at Avocaderia, it was clear why it's seeing so much success and praise — the food was delicious, affordable, and fast. It was also packed with millennials taking Instagram photos and indulging in all of the different avocado-based meals the restaurant had to offer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p70q2pmqyVnMZwv9OrmK2dl656tLTAq6JmrJGjuG61za%2BcrKyfp8BuucCromabpZeur3nAp5tmmpGnr6K%2BwGaaqKqTpL%2BiuoyjrKysXZ67t7HSrZydZ2WYgLuuknA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
