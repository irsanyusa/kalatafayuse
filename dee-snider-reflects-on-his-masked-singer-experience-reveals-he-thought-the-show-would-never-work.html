Despite the challenges, Snider loved every moment of it.</p><p>Initially, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snider</a> was skeptical about The Masked Singer‘s concept and turned down an offer to participate in the first season. However, after seeing the show’s success, he decided to join in on the fun.</p><p>“I had a blast on The Masked Singer,” Snider said. “I hope that by taking this chance, I’ve encouraged others to do the same and take risks in their own lives. You never know what might happen.”</p><p>Looking back on his time on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Masked Singer</a>, Snider is proud of what he accomplished.
