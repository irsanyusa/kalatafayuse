These hotels are helping fans of E.L. James’ erotic trilogy recreate some of their favorite scenes from the wildly popular books with special hotel packages complete with bottles of pinot gris, rides in Audis (the car of choice for Christian Grey, the novel’s titular billionaire sex machine), and helicopter tours of Portland and Seattle. Couples looking to dabble in domination will have to bring their own riding crops, though, as the hotels seem more focused on the lavish lifestyles in the books than the blush-inducing erotica they’re better known for.</p><p>The Edgewater Hotel in Seattle, Wa. offers a <a href=#>“50 Shades of Romance”</a> package, which gives guests one of the hotel’s deluxe rooms, along with a bottle of Bollinger Rosé — protagonist Anastasia Steele’s&nbsp;champagne of choice — a sailing excursion around Puget Sound, a demo drive in an Audi and a customized map to local 50 Shades of Grey&nbsp;landmarks and a copy of the book for inspiration.</p><p>(<strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=#>The Shy British Mum Behind 50 Shades of Grey</a>)</p><p>Portland’s <a href=#>Heathman Hotel</a>, which fans will know is where&nbsp;Christian and Ana had their first tryst and quite a few steamy encounters thereafter, is offering two add-on packages including the “Inner Goddess Addition” — namely a bottle of pinot gris for a mere $40. Big spenders looking to recreate Miss Steele’s birthday party can opt for the “Charlie Tango No Limits” package featuring appetizers and white wine at the hotel restaurant for six people, a helicopter tour of the city, roses for the women, dinner at the hotel and limo transfers. The package costs $2,750, so bringing along your own billionaire to foot the bill is highly recommended.</p><p>(<strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=#>50 Shades of Grey: Why Is It News That Women Like Sex?</a>)</p><p>Seattle’s&nbsp;<a href=#>Hotel Max</a> offers the “Fifty Shades of Seattle” package, &nbsp;including a&nbsp;two-night stay for two on the hotel’s “romantic” 8th floor, which, according to <a href=#>ABC News</a>,&nbsp; is decorated with photographer Amy Mullen’s series “The Making of a Date” — a collection that is “sure to set the mood for love,” at least according to the hotel. The package also features&nbsp;a bottle of Bollinger Grande Annee Rose 1999, a 30-minute helicopter ride and a chauffeured ride in a luxury town car. Becoming your favorite character for the night doesn’t come cheap, though. The package is $1,669.</p><p>The 50 Shades fun isn’t just for those fantasy-seeking tourists in the Pacific Northwest, though. Three of the boutique Personality Hotels now offer “50 Shades of Women” packages for couples hoping to get in touch with their inner bondage geek in San Francisco. Included in the package is deluxe accommodation and a “sexy black box” — a so-called intimacy kit designed by upscale sex toy company Minna Life, the contents of which are <a href=# rel=nofollow>best read on the hotel chain’s website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAp7HEnWWtoZ2ae6S7zGhpaWliZH14e49vZq2Zm5p6onmUaWSsoJGZsrR5zp9koKqVrnq3rcKaq6KnnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
