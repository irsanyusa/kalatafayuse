They are talented in&nbsp;their careers and a&nbsp;loving couple who always support each other.

It&nbsp;happened in&nbsp;2013 when they were filming <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Big Ask</i>.</a> Since then, they have been fortunate to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cast</a> in&nbsp;several projects alongside each other. They even had the opportunity to&nbsp;portray siblings in&nbsp;the film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>We’ll Never Have Paris</i></a>. Their on-screen collaborations have allowed their relationship to&nbsp;grow and flourish.</p><p><h2>Jason’s proposal to&nbsp;Melanie was absolutely adorable.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a36/7e5/73ee23584da393403861d5df67.jpg><p>Melanie and Jason had a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>relationship</a> for four years until 2017 when Jason proposed. The proposal was a&nbsp;complete surprise to&nbsp;Melanie, as&nbsp;she had no&nbsp;idea it&nbsp;would happen. Jason chose a&nbsp;casual setting on&nbsp;their sofa to&nbsp;pop the question. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, Melanie simply described it&nbsp;as&nbsp;“cute,” leaving it&nbsp;at&nbsp;that.</p><p><h2>Their family expanded and grew a&nbsp;little bit more.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0b3/779/365a075f52b4ddd8754acc5555.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2018, just a&nbsp;year after their engagement, Melanie and Jason joyfully welcomed a&nbsp;baby girl into their lives. Melanie shared the happy news on&nbsp;her social media, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressing</a> their gratitude for being able to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret among close friends and family for some time. However, the news eventually got out, prompting her to&nbsp;confirm and share their excitement.</p><p>Since then, the actress has regularly posted adorable pictures of&nbsp;their daughter with her doting dad. In&nbsp;one photo, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>captioned</a> it&nbsp;with affection, describing their little girl as&nbsp;knowing she has the best dad in&nbsp;the world. Melanie also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spoke</a> about their teamwork in&nbsp;parenting, “He’s so&nbsp;helpful, so&nbsp;supportive, and he’s willing to&nbsp;travel with me&nbsp;so&nbsp;that the family can be&nbsp;together,” she said. “I&nbsp;do the same for him, but I’ve been working a&nbsp;lot recently, so&nbsp;he’s been making the sacrifice more often than I&nbsp;have.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/636/792/792cdc5ce29c6587fe3be0ed50.jpg><p><h2>The couple had a&nbsp;rushed wedding.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b0/14a/13a1ad582e8167187ddf3dd493.jpg><p>Jason and Melanie opted for a&nbsp;small, intimate wedding with just six people in&nbsp;attendance. The reason behind their rushed ceremony was a&nbsp;misunderstanding. Someone misinformed Melanie that Jason needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;married to&nbsp;enter Canada for her&nbsp;TV show <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>filming</a> in&nbsp;Vancouver, which turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;untrue, as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> by&nbsp;the actress.</p><p>With this false information, Melanie panicked and felt compelled to&nbsp;get married immediately, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>exclaiming</a>, “We&nbsp;have a&nbsp;child, what? We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;get married tomorrow.” Their wedding took place on&nbsp;their front porch, officiated by&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind woman Melanie called a&nbsp;“nice lady.” The guest list included two close friends and, of&nbsp;course, their daughter.</p><p><h2>Melanie has faced unwarranted comments about her appearance throughout her career.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/67f/983/5bcc905aa8abe72c79e86bff06.jpg><p>Melanie has faced challenges, including hurtful comments about her weight from colleagues and online. She vividly remembers a&nbsp;particular incident while filming <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Coyote Ugly</i></a> when the costume designer made insensitive remarks, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “’Nobody told me&nbsp;there would be&nbsp;girls like you.’ Really intense feedback about my&nbsp;physicality, my&nbsp;body.”</p><p><h2>Jason stood up&nbsp;for Melanie and defended her against online trolls.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/850/d20/acf9e05aa78a3da3e2374105ce.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News<span>, </span>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;early 2022, Melanie spoke out about the negative comments regarding her body that some people made online. She expressed her frustration with the backhanded remarks, where people would pretend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;concerned about her health. In&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>response</a>, the actress highlighted, “You don’t see me&nbsp;on&nbsp;my&nbsp;Peloton! You don’t see me&nbsp;running through the park with my&nbsp;child. Skinny does not always equal healthy,” a&nbsp;sentiment that resonates with many.</p><p>Even Melanie’s husband, Jason, supported her by&nbsp;posting a&nbsp;clever message on&nbsp;his social media. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “If&nbsp;anyone has any further unsolicited comments about *anybody* else’s body, they can feel free to&nbsp;write them in&nbsp;permanent ink onto their own foreheads and swan dive directly into the sun.”</p><p><h2>The couple consistently provides support for one another.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/116/ef0/1e90e45be1bb9a9235b4d65ae5.jpg><p>Jason serves as&nbsp;Melanie’s personal cheerleader when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;her career. He&nbsp;supports her by&nbsp;helping with auditions and providing encouragement when they face challenges or&nbsp;feel nervous about a&nbsp;scene. Jason <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admires</a> Melanie’s talent and considers her a&nbsp;fantastic actress who inspires him.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, when asked about her husband, Melanie expressed, “I&nbsp;honestly feel like&nbsp;I won the lottery, I&nbsp;have the greatest husband, he’s such a&nbsp;good dad, he&nbsp;loves&nbsp;me, he&nbsp;makes me&nbsp;feel beautiful no&nbsp;matter what, he’s a&nbsp;good, good person, and he’s so&nbsp;cute.” partnership.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/900/b2a/b876e4539b81c6aeb41bdda350.jpg><p><h2>Their anniversary</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/118/332/0b084f56a3b4daa3c64ed11d95.jpg><p>Melanie Lynskey recently <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>celebrated</a> her anniversary with her husband, Jason Ritter, by&nbsp;sharing a&nbsp;heartfelt post on&nbsp;social media. In&nbsp;the caption, she expressed her joy and love, addressing Jason as&nbsp;a&nbsp;wonderful, kind, and beautiful man. Melanie playfully acknowledged the limited number of&nbsp;event pictures, sharing one with her followers.</p><p>Celebrities have increasingly taken a&nbsp;stand against body shamers, using their platforms to&nbsp;defend their wives and promote body positivity. One notable <a href=#>example</a> is&nbsp;the beloved actor Tom Hanks, known for his talent and genuine personality. When faced with unwarranted criticism towards his wife’s appearance, Hanks did not hesitate to&nbsp;speak out in&nbsp;her defense.</p><p>Preview photo credit Invision / Invision / East News<span>, </span>Invision / Invision / East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLeiv86nZKuhpKmys3nRnqqpp56ZwG7AzmaZqJypYsCprcyeqaxlp528bsPEq5xmrJGntKbAyKeeZqCZqHq4tcWeZKadnJa7qrGMpbCnq5uaxm6EkGxtbGhf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
