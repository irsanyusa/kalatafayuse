That‚Äôs the issue with broken families The father divorced his mom 21 years ago and his mother is fine with it . It‚Äôs even <strong>wofai</strong> I pity , she‚Äôs too hardworking and unproblematic for this - @NoHarm_Intended</li><li>It is irresponsible for the Cole family to have released this statement no matter the situation It is now a monumental embarrassment for all parties involved I wish <strong>Wofai</strong> the best in this journey ahead I hope their union stands the test of time, trials and tribulations - @McBluetoothCCFR</li><li>The Cole ‚Äös family is well within their rights to put out any disclaimer. What would you have done in their position? The age difference aside, <strong>Wofai</strong> is grown enough to know how these things would play out ! maybe she doesn‚Äôt mind though. no Jada - @Ejude44</li><li>Apparently, Ola Cole‚Äôs mum followed him to <strong>Wofai</strong>‚Äôs village for the traditional marriage. His mum and dad divorced 27 years ago. According to the dad, the mum doesn‚Äôt even have that right Wahala for Cole family of Victoria Island - @DeborahToluwase</li><li>Same Taiwo Cole wey no dey allow juniors sleep till 3 in the morning because he wants to be massaged?? With that his smelly shoe ?? same nigga that slaps junior students like he‚Äôs the headmaster of the school. <strong>Wofai</strong> eye go peel ! I will be here insha Allah - @mxtolani</li><li><strong>Wofai</strong> has unfortunately become a collateral damage in what appears to be an ego tussle between the groom's father and divorced mother. Has nothing to do with her. They're using the proposed marriage to settle existing grouse. Interesting to see how the young man handles this. - @UnkleAyo</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGawp5aWtrR51p6bnaGenHqosdOsZKado6jGbq3SZquhnV2YvK2xjJ%2BYpqGcrnqzscmemq2rXaq7qrvNZq6irJhiwamxyKtkrKeeZMWytsRum6Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
