While Perry and her fellow judges, Lionel Richie and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke Bryan</a>, were busy working with the show’s hopeful contestants, Daisy was having the time of her life with her idols.</p><p>“She went to breakfast and met Minnie and Mickey and she’s not scared at all,” Perry said. “She ran up to Mickey, she sang with Moana, I sang with Moana, it was amazing.”&nbsp;</p><p>According to Perry, Daisy is fearless and has already spent time at Disneyland Tokyo and celebrated Christmas with Mickey last winter. Perry then revealed that she accidentally named her daughter after Daisy Duck, and it seems like Daisy is living up to her name by embracing all things Disney.</p><p>It seems like Daisy had a blast exploring Hawaii with her mom while Perry continues to work on the show. With her fearless and adventurous spirit, it’s no surprise that Daisy is already following in her mom’s footsteps.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>American Idol Expands The Next Round to a Top 26</h2><p>This season of American Idol has expanded its bracket to include a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Top 26</a>, with more new talent emerging every day. Perry shared that they couldn’t pare it down to just 24 contestants because they had really good talent and couldn’t bear to send anyone home.</p><p>The judges and host Ryan Seacrest are working in Hawaii with mentors Noah Cyrus and Allen Stone. Cyrus previously opened for Perry on her Witness Tour in 2017, and Perry gushed about her latest record, saying it is “beautiful and vulnerable.”</p><p>Stone expressed his admiration for Lionel Richie, who has touched every moment in American music history, and he felt honored to have had the opportunity to work with him.
