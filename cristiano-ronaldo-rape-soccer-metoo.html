But in the last few days, his name hasn’t been in headlines for winning championships or<a href=# rel=noopener> crying on the pitch</a> after being issued a red card. His name is flashing across screens because a 34 year-old woman named Kathryn Mayorga, has come forward to say Ronaldo brutally raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">How is it possible that a story that sports media in North America had no interest in publishing less than two years ago, is now splashed all over every screen and social media platform? This case was not reported on by any major outlet, except for a story in 2017 by the independent German newspaper <a href=# rel=noopener>Der Spiegel</a>. Besides a select few commenting on social media (<a href=# rel=noopener>myself included</a>), the case against Ronaldo got no traction. Fast forward 18 months, Der Spiegel published another story. This time, it was a detailed account from <a href=# rel=noopener>Kathryn Mayorga</a> herself. The publication spent more than 20 days with her and held countless interviews, fact checked and re-checked before publishing it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The documents acquired by Der Spiegel were damning and according to a recent Twitter thread by one of the main authors, <a href=# rel=noopener>Christoph Winterbach</a>, there were more than 20 staff involved in working on the article. In response. Ronaldo’s lawyer and his team made a lot of noise as part of their legal posturing and even accused der Spiegel’s piece of being “illegal” because “it violates the personal rights” of Ronaldo. Laughable at best.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For those who understand the law, and the severity of the crime, there is much substance in this story. Back in 2009, Mayorga’s inexperienced lawyer (who had specialized in traffic violations) was no match for Ronaldo’s PR mega-machine and legal team, and ended up settling with them for $375,000 on the condition Mayorga not speak about the incident. But Mayorga’s new legal team is disputing that contract and arguing that she was mentally deficient due to trauma from rape, and was not competent enough to make a proper decision at the time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">They have filed a civil suit on Mayorga’s behalf and the case has since been re-opened by the Las Vegas police. In Nevada, the statute of limitations has not expired for this crime. Mayorga has not only suffered physically (the hospital documented her injuries in a rape kit when she reported the crime), but she continues to suffer from that trauma to this day and—according to her lawyer—is in “active therapy.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ronaldo initially called the allegations “fake news” and insinuated that Mayorga was trying to get famous using his name. I have worked with survivors of violence and have yet to meet or know of a victim who has enjoyed any of the bullying, shame, societal isolation and mental health upheavals, and wanted to claim some type of infamy from an attack. And I won’t even dignify the ridiculous notion of “false accusations.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Writing about rape culture in the soccer world is a struggle. Before the 2015 UEFA Championships, I heard about allegations against Spanish goalkeeper and Manchester United star David De Gea, who was implicated in a horrible rape case. I pitched that piece to at least ten different outlets and no one was interested in publishing it and paying me for my work. Thankfully, <a href=# rel=noopener>I found it a home</a> at a soccer site entirely run by women. And they backed me up when the online harassment started to descend. I have only tweeted about Ronaldo thus far and the responses to my tweets have been violent and angry—presumably from Ronaldo supporters. Another indication of the hatred casually flung at women for speaking up.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mayorga’s attorney has said that she was enabled by hearing survivors in the #MeToo movement disclose their own stories. There is a strong tide of women speaking up courageously, slowly washing away the impunity often enjoyed by powerful misogynists and abusers. Perhaps #MeToo has finally transcended into the realm of sports, a realm where it is desperately needed. With cases like <a href=# rel=noopener>Patrick Kane</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Kobe Bryant</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Baylor University’s football</a> team, and other men who rarely face consequences for their actions, it is needed now more than ever.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Predictably, the same sports media who initially had no interest in this story have become “experts” in criminal law, and on sexualized violence. The <a href=# rel=noopener>vacuous reporting</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>unnecessary reflections</a> are mostly done by men, and center the 33-year-old star. Opinions on <a href=# rel=noopener>due </a><a href=# rel=noopener>process</a> (reminder: it’s a legal system not a justice system) and about <a href=# rel=noopener>Ronaldo’s </a><a href=# rel=noopener>athletic prowess and teams </a>don’t have anything to do with this case in which he is accused of anally raping a woman, <a href=# rel=noopener>who by his own accord</a>, told him “no.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The way that these stories are reported by sports journalists who have little or no training in reporting accurately on sexualized violence can be re-traumatizing for many survivors. Instead of investing in <a href=# rel=noopener>proper </a><a href=# rel=noopener>media tool kits</a> compiled by <a href=# rel=noopener>advocates </a><a href=# rel=noopener>for victims of violence</a> (all free), editors unleash a bevy of unhelpful pieces that contribute to an unhealthy society steeped in <a href=# rel=noopener>rape </a><a href=# rel=noopener>apologism</a>. On that night in 2009, Mayorga was dancing with Ronaldo. Does that mean she invited rape? No. These outlets are complicit in the way that victim blaming and shaming become part of natural discourse when rape is reported.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Then there is the sexist sports establishment itself. Since the most recent news broke out, the predictably irrelevant statements of solidarity from Ronaldo’s supporters have emerged. His current team Juventus FC tweeted out nonsensically reminding Twitter that Ronaldo has conducted himself with “professionalism” and “dedication.” The issue at hand is not whether he is a “champion.” How Ronaldo performs on the pitch is not correlated to the fact that he may have brutally violated a woman. The issues must not be conflated.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@Cristiano</a> Ronaldo has shown in recent months his great professionalism and dedication, which is appreciated by everyone at Juventus. 1/1</p>— JuventusFC 🇬🇧🇺🇸 (@juventusfcen) <a href=#>October 4, 2018</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>The events allegedly dating back to almost 10 years ago do not change this opinion, which is shared by anyone who has come into contact with this great champion. 2/2</p>— JuventusFC 🇬🇧🇺🇸 (@juventusfcen) <a href=#>October 4, 2018</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ronaldo was left off of the Portuguese national team roster for upcoming international matches—but not because the Portuguese football federation felt it necessary to exclude him from the squad for being charged with a violent crime. They somehow managed to explain this decision while singing his praises. Portugal national men’s coach Fernando Santos said in a news conference on Thursday, “[Federation] president Fernando Gomes and I spoke with Cristiano Ronaldo and we considered it best for the player not to be included in this and November’s call-ups.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He went on to wax poetic about the alleged rapist: “I personally always support my players, and this is not even a question of solidarity, but I believe what the player said publicly. He considers rape to be an abominable crime and clearly reaffirms that he is innocent of what he is being accused of. I know Cristiano well and I fully believe he would not commit a crime like that.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">How nice for Ronaldo for people to believe him because he works hard and people are familiar with his persona. And while Nike and EA Games, two of Ronaldo’s major corporate sponsors, are “concerned” with the allegations, it is not enough to have them pull their money away—even though Ronaldo allegedly used sponsorship money to settle with Mayorga in 2009. The reluctance to cut ties with a powerful athlete underlines that the dignity of a woman is not worth sacrificing profits from soccer cleats.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">#MeToo has yet to be championed the way that alleged rapists are.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubGFrf3Z9jpypoquknq6vu4yrpqeZnJm8br7AqZxmq5%2BYsKa%2BjKacraefZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
