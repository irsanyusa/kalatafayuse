She left everyone giving their take in the comments section about whether or not Grande really is the best living vocalist on Earth</strong>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-ariana-grande-the-best-living-vocalist>Is Ariana Grande ‘the Best Living Vocalist’?</h2><p>After Perry tweeted what she knew would generate buzz, fans gathered in the comments section to debate her claim. They raised many questions about artists like Adele, Christina Aguilera, <a href=# class=broken_link>Mariah Carey</a>, Beyonce, and <a href=#>Celine Dion</a> who are all very strong vocalists. There were also a bunch of die-hard Arianators in the mix who completely agree with Perry.</p><p>Grande has already established herself as one of the best, if not the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best live performer</a> of this generation. She has literally slayed any award show appearance, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">talk show appearance,</a> or concert that she has done from the start of her career. It also didn’t take long for people to realize that she was the standout vocalist on the show Victorious which first aired in 2010. She even out-sang the show’s star, Victoria Justice.</p><p>There is clearly a reason why Grande is one of the most-streamed artists of all time. The “7 Rings” singer has dominated the Billboard charts and garnered over <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">19 billion views on YouTube.</a> She just had a truly unforgettable performance with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Weeknd</a> at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The 2021 iHeart Radio Music Awards</a> that left people in the audience in tears just because of her presence. Her whistle tones are perfect, but we can’t deny that Carey is the one who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">popularized this technique</a> in her music.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>happiest birthday to the best living vocalist on earth @ArianaGrande fight me if you think different</p>— KATY PERRY (@katyperry) <a href=#>June 25, 2021</a></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mariah-carey-fans-disagree-with-perry>Mariah Carey Fans Disagree with Perry</h2><p>“When Mariah Carey exists…. you’ve just embarrassed yourself,” one fan wrote under Perry’s tweet.</p><p>Carey had a very <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">disastrous performance</a> during New Year’s Eve&nbsp;in 2016. She was invited back to redeem herself and proved to literally everyone that she still has that incredibly unique tone. Her songs “We Belong Together” and “Always Be My Baby” are timeless. It goes without saying that a person’s vocal range can change over the years but Carey has been able to adapt well to these changes.</p><p>She has really been working on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fine-tuning her lower register.</a> Though Carey is the original R&B diva, Grande has definitely been a more consistent vocalist in the past decade. The pop genre is currently being dominated by Grande and her very successful 2020 album Positions. You can’t walk into a retail store without hearing her songs blaring over the speakers. It’s impossible not to pay attention to her beautiful voice.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-do-other-artists-measure-up-to-grande-vocally>How Do Other Artists Measure Up to Grande Vocally?</h2><p>Aguilera, a mezzo-soprano, has also been one of the original <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">queens of vocal runs.</a> Some may even call it vocal gymnastics. Songs like “Hurt” and “Fighter” show off Aguilera’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">versatility as an artist</a>. Beyonce also has a huge song catalogue with some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>shining vocal moments</a> in “Best Thing I Never Had” and “Halo.” Adele established herself as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a vocal master</a> from the start with “Rolling in the Deep.” And, there really isn’t any other song out there even comparable to Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On.”</p><p>So many other artists definitely have demonstrated their vocal chops in their respective careers. Each of them is very different and offers something unique to the world of music. However, when it comes to which artist is the most timely and has consistently put out music that conquers the airwaves, Grande definitely reigns supreme. The point Perry was probably trying to make is that Grande essentially never stops working to achieve greatness as an artist in this generation. Simply put, Grande has a great voice and wants you to know it.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1144024620.jpg alt="‘Wahlburgers’ Star Henry ‘Nacho’ Laun Dies of Apparent Cocaine Overdose" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57ypqrsmWgmr%2BzxYycmKWko2Kus7XAp5hmn6KWu6WxjK2fnmWSmsC1ecuiraKml2LDsK%2FApaCsrF2ku26xwKuroWWZqHq0tMRmqaKfmKl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
