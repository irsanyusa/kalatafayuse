The Algerian athlete spoke about her tumultuous Olympic experience on Sunday night in an interview with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press.
“I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,” Khelif said in Arabic."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>What to Know About the Gender Fight in Olympic Boxing</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The victories of Khelif and fellow boxer <a href=#>Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan</a> in the ring in Paris have become one of the biggest stories of the Paris Games. Both women have <a href=#>clinched their first Olympic medals</a> even as they have faced online abuse based on unsubstantiated claims about their gender, drawing them into a wider divide over changing attitudes toward gender identity and regulations in sports.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The 25-year-old Khelif acknowledged the pressure and pain of enduring this ordeal while competing far from home in the most important event of her athletic career.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I am in contact with my family two days a week. I hope that they weren’t affected deeply,” she said. “They are worried about me. God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal, and that would be the best response.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/imane-khelif-boxing-olympics-medal.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The vitriol stems from claims by the International Boxing Association, which has been permanently banned from the Olympics, that both Khelif and Lin failed unspecified eligibility tests for the women’s competition at last year’s world championships.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Khelif declined to answer when asked whether she had undergone tests other than doping tests, saying she didn’t want to talk about it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She expressed gratitude to the International Olympic Committee and its president, Thomas Bach, for standing resolutely behind her while the banned former governing body of Olympic boxing stoked a furor around her participation in Paris.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I know that the Olympic Committee has done me justice, and I am happy with this remedy because it shows the truth,” she said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Olympic Boxers Don’t Want to Talk About the Gender Controversy</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She also has seen massive support at her bouts, drawing cheers when she enters the arena and crowds waving Algerian flags chanting her first name. She will fight again Tuesday in the women’s 66-kilogram semifinals at Roland Garros.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Khelif repeatedly made clear she won’t allow chatter or accusations to deter her from attempting to claim Algeria’s first Olympic gold medal in women’s boxing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I don’t care about anyone’s opinion,” Khelif said a day after beating Anna Luca Hamori of Hungary. “I came here for a medal, and to compete for a medal. I will certainly be competing to improve (and) be better, and God willing, I will improve, like every other athlete.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Although she is aware of the worldwide discussion about her, Khelif said she has been somewhat removed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Honestly, I don’t follow social media,” she said. “There is a mental health team that doesn’t let us follow social media, especially in the Olympic Games, whether me or other athletes. I’m here to compete and get a good result.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Khelif started her Olympic run last Thursday with a victory over Angela Carini of Italy, who abandoned the bout after just 46 seconds. Carini later said she regretted her decision and wished to apologize to Khelif.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That unusual ending raised the chatter around Khelif into a roar, drawing comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, “Harry Potter” writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Taiwan Turns Against J.K. Rowling for Stirring Olympic Boxing Gender Controversy</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The IOC repeatedly declared her and Lin qualified to participate in the Olympics, and it has decried the murky testing standards and untransparent governance of the IBA, which was banished entirely from the Olympics last year in an unprecedented punishment for a governing body.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Khelif clearly felt the weight of the worldwide scrutiny upon her, and her victory over Hamori on Saturday appeared to be cathartic. After the referee raised Khelif’s hand with the win, she went to the center of the ring, waved to her fans, knelt and slammed her palm on the canvas, her smile turning to tears.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I couldn’t control my nerves,” Khelif said in the interview. “Because after the media frenzy and after the victory, there was a mix of joy and at the same time, I was greatly affected, because honestly, it wasn’t an easy thing to go through at all. It was something that harms human dignity.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/imane-khelif-woman-female-algeria.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She had competed in IBA events for several years without problems until she was abruptly suspended from last year’s world championships. The Russian-dominated body—which has faced years of clashes with the IOC—has refused to provide any information about the tests.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Algeria’s national boxing federation is still an IBA member.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Khelif is from rural northwestern Algeria, and she grew up playing soccer until she fell in love with boxing. Overcoming her father’s initial objections, she traveled 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) by bus to train for fights in a neighboring town.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After reaching the sport’s top level in her late teens, she struggled early in her career before reaching an elite level. Khelif has been a solid, if unspectacular, international competitor for six years, and she lost to eventual gold medalist Kellie Harrington of Ireland at the Tokyo Olympics.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Khelif’s next bout in Paris is against Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand. If Khelif wins again, she will fight for a gold medal Friday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Yes, this issue involves the dignity and honor of every woman and female,” she told an Algerian broadcaster in brief remarks Sunday after beating Hamori. “The Arab population has known me for years and has seen me box in the IBA that wronged me (and) treated me unfairly, but I have God on my side.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">—Habbari is an SNTV videojournalist.
