We&nbsp;can write them off as&nbsp;eclipses or&nbsp;“just some weather events.” But in&nbsp;reality, they’re very creepy, and we&nbsp;have no&nbsp;idea why they happen.</p><p>So, what are these “dark days” anyway? What’s so&nbsp;strange about them? Let’s try to&nbsp;find out. “The Sun is&nbsp;off. What are we&nbsp;gonna&nbsp;do?” That’s what the residents of&nbsp;Yamal, Siberia, asked meteorologists on&nbsp;September&nbsp;18, 1938.</p><p>In&nbsp;the morning, instead of&nbsp;going to&nbsp;work, they all gathered at&nbsp;the weather station. They were waiting for answers. All because on&nbsp;that day, they observed something inexplicable. An&nbsp;“eclipse,” which they later nicknamed “the black day.” And neither astronomers nor meteorologists can explain what happened back then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3c6/d1b/98a2495ba193aa38341debcea7.png><p>Here is&nbsp;how one of&nbsp;them described this event, “At&nbsp;8.30&nbsp;AM, we&nbsp;noted a&nbsp;decrease in&nbsp;light. At&nbsp;the same time, the color of&nbsp;the clouds began to&nbsp;acquire a&nbsp;yellowish-brown, sometimes red-brown hue. By&nbsp;9&nbsp;AM, the lighting had changed dramatically. It&nbsp;was as&nbsp;if&nbsp;you were looking at&nbsp;the world through a&nbsp;dark light filter. The brown tones of&nbsp;the clouds intensified. By&nbsp;10.30&nbsp;AM, the sky and Earth didn’t differ from each other in&nbsp;lighting and color. Everything seemed homogeneous&nbsp;— black, absolutely devoid of&nbsp;light.” Pretty creepy, right? And that’s not all.</p><p>The city was also plunged into complete radio silence. Meteorologists couldn’t even contact the authorities, and local residents were unable to&nbsp;set up&nbsp;any stations. Everyone was in&nbsp;the dark&nbsp;— both literally and figuratively. Meteorologists decided to&nbsp;try and launch several flares. The flares soared into the air toward the heavy dark clouds hanging over the city... and disappeared. The clouds were so&nbsp;dense that the flares were completely invisible.</p><p>At&nbsp;the same time, the weather was perfectly fine. Everything was quiet. And this black silence lasted for about an&nbsp;hour. After that, the “black day” ended as&nbsp;unexpectedly as&nbsp;it&nbsp;began. Even more baffling, those strange clouds left literally no&nbsp;trace. No&nbsp;rain, no&nbsp;dust, nothing. After that event, researchers found out that the “black day” had spread for 125–155 miles around. They also learned that the dark band was moving from west to&nbsp;east. After passing through the southern part of&nbsp;the Yamal Peninsula, it&nbsp;headed on&nbsp;for a&nbsp;while and then disappeared completely.</p><p>Yamal isn’t the only place where this phenomenon occurred. In&nbsp;fact, similar “eclipses” have been happening in&nbsp;different parts of&nbsp;Earth for many years. For example, in&nbsp;New England. On&nbsp;May&nbsp;19, 1780, people there witnessed an&nbsp;event that was later called “New England’s Dark Day.” But it&nbsp;lasted not one day but several.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/46e/245/9040525637b22ff017adc26c92.png><p>A&nbsp;few days before this event, the sky turned yellow. And on&nbsp;May&nbsp;19, in&nbsp;broad daylight, it&nbsp;suddenly turned black. Here’s what one of&nbsp;the witnesses, Joseph Plumb Martin, later told the press, “It&nbsp;was very dark. People had to&nbsp;light candles in&nbsp;their houses to&nbsp;carry on&nbsp;their usual business. The night was as&nbsp;uncommonly dark as&nbsp;the day was.” The smell of&nbsp;soot reigned in&nbsp;the air. Nearby rivers were covered with a&nbsp;thin layer of&nbsp;ash.</p><p>When the real night came, people noticed through the clouds that the Moon had turned dark red. Only a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days later, people were finally able to&nbsp;see stars through the veil of&nbsp;clouds. And then everything suddenly returned to&nbsp;normal. No&nbsp;one had any idea what had happened.</p><p>22&nbsp;years later, on&nbsp;June&nbsp;2, 1802, a&nbsp;schooner named “El&nbsp;Dorado” sailed across the Pacific Ocean. Suddenly, they were overtaken by&nbsp;complete darkness. There was no&nbsp;<a href=# title=storm data-link=tag>storm</a>, and the ocean was completely calm. But the whole sky was covered with black clouds. These clouds dissipated after half an&nbsp;hour and left no&nbsp;trace.</p><p>And again, 74&nbsp;years later. One of&nbsp;the “dark waves” happened in&nbsp;Wisconsin on&nbsp;March&nbsp;19, 1886. It&nbsp;was 3&nbsp;PM, and this time, the wave was very short&nbsp;— it&nbsp;lasted only 5–10&nbsp;minutes. A&nbsp;sudden night fell on&nbsp;the city. Frightened horses were neighing, and terrified people were running around, trying to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;place to&nbsp;hide.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/87f/874/96b8b5557794f131de83857e4e.png><p>When everything calmed down, local newspapers reported that the wave passed from west to&nbsp;east. There was no&nbsp;solar eclipse, no&nbsp;winds or&nbsp;hurricanes... Nothing that could cause the darkness over the city. And finally, once again, it&nbsp;happened on&nbsp;December&nbsp;2, 1904, in&nbsp;Memphis. Or&nbsp;rather that’s what rumors claim since there’s almost no&nbsp;scientific evidence of&nbsp;this event. It&nbsp;was clear and cold dawn over Bluff City. People were doing their usual Friday morning chores.</p><p>Then, around nine in&nbsp;the morning, without any warning, the Sun suddenly disappeared from the sky. It&nbsp;took only a&nbsp;minute for the bright sunny day to&nbsp;turn into pitch darkness. People interrupted their work, and children in&nbsp;schools were completely terrified. One loader clung to&nbsp;a&nbsp;telegraph pole with all his might, too scared to&nbsp;let&nbsp;go. Everyone started lighting gas and oil lamps. And, just like in&nbsp;previous cases, the weather was perfectly calm.</p><p>It&nbsp;lasted about half an&nbsp;hour and then suddenly ended. A&nbsp;little later, following a&nbsp;mysterious eclipse, a&nbsp;ferocious storm hit the city. So... What’s going&nbsp;on? All these strange cases can surely be&nbsp;explained scientifically, right? Well... Actually, scientists don’t have a&nbsp;definite answer. All these events are very similar, but we&nbsp;don’t have a&nbsp;single explanation that could cover them all.</p><p>Let’s take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;some theories. The first thought that comes to&nbsp;mind&nbsp;— “it’s probably a&nbsp;partial or&nbsp;total eclipse.” But&nbsp;no, this is&nbsp;not the case. There were no&nbsp;eclipses on&nbsp;those days. And even if&nbsp;we&nbsp;consider this theory&nbsp;— before any eclipse, the sky darkens gradually. Eclipses themselves last only a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;minutes; certainly not a&nbsp;few hours or&nbsp;even days. Also, unlike eclipses, these events were local to&nbsp;specific cities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4f0/aef/97c2df587d84364b5f7694057c.png><p>Well, maybe it’s some other astronomical event? Some scientists believed that during the event on&nbsp;Yamal, a&nbsp;band of&nbsp;cosmic dust touched Earth. But later, they found out that no&nbsp;astronomical bodies approached the planet that day. Alright, any other ideas? Forest fires could be&nbsp;the reason. When a&nbsp;large area of&nbsp;forest is&nbsp;burning at&nbsp;the same time, a&nbsp;column of&nbsp;air can rise to&nbsp;great heights, like 3–4&nbsp;miles.</p><p>These air flows carry ash and other burned stuff to&nbsp;different places. And, since all these things are so&nbsp;high in&nbsp;the sky, they simply freeze there and turn into something resembling black clouds. That was probably the case for New England&nbsp;— at&nbsp;that time, a&nbsp;wave of&nbsp;forest fires broke out in&nbsp;Canada. They could easily spread to&nbsp;the north of&nbsp;the US. Also, just look at&nbsp;this description: yellowed sky, the smell of&nbsp;soot, ash on&nbsp;the water...</p><p>Everything sounds logical. But this theory of&nbsp;fires only works for the event in&nbsp;New England. What about the other cases? Where would you find a&nbsp;forest fire in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the Pacific Ocean, for example? Alright, moving&nbsp;on. Scientists tried to&nbsp;explain the story from Memphis by&nbsp;saying it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;hurricane.</p><p>But the black cloud swept through the city BEFORE the storm, not during or&nbsp;after&nbsp;it. And it&nbsp;wasn’t some kind of&nbsp;typical storm cloud&nbsp;— it&nbsp;was full-fledged night darkness. So&nbsp;what’s really going&nbsp;on? Now, meteorologists call this phenomenon a&nbsp;“local decrease in&nbsp;the transparency of&nbsp;the atmosphere.” Unlike solar eclipses, this darkness is&nbsp;“denser.” It&nbsp;also covers only a&nbsp;small area.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7ad/06d/bf75c65c67a2cd2cf84580a6a1.png><p>The “transparency of&nbsp;the atmosphere” is&nbsp;its ability to&nbsp;let through radiation and light. It’s basically, “How well can&nbsp;I see distant objects?” Everything can get dark and blurry, for example, because of&nbsp;dust in&nbsp;the air, volcanic eruptions, fogs, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>So, according to&nbsp;this theory, “dark days” are just an&nbsp;extreme drop in&nbsp;the transparency of&nbsp;the atmosphere. But it’s still strange. If&nbsp;that’s the case, shouldn’t everything have been covered with thick fog or&nbsp;something like that? Yeah, it&nbsp;was very dark. But when people lit the lamps, the visibility was pretty good. Nothing blocked the view except the black clouds that covered the Sun.</p><p>In&nbsp;other words, this phenomenon is&nbsp;very hard to&nbsp;explain. As&nbsp;far as&nbsp;we&nbsp;know, it&nbsp;has happened only 5–6 times in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;humankind. If&nbsp;there were other cases, they weren’t documented. This phenomenon is&nbsp;impossible to&nbsp;predict, and no&nbsp;one knows how it&nbsp;works&nbsp;— as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;where and when it&nbsp;will happen next time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bb8/acc/68e0be50729ff271ea01ae77d1.png><p>And although there are many hypotheses, none of&nbsp;them can be&nbsp;verified. Maybe if&nbsp;these events happen again in&nbsp;the future, we’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;study them better. But unfortunately, at&nbsp;the moment, the “dark days” remain a&nbsp;mystery.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have any theories or&nbsp;ideas on&nbsp;this?
