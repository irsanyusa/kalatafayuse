Shelton and Daly along with the host of the show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nikki Bella</a>, will see their celebrity friends compete in a series of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bar games</a> taken to the next level.</p><p>“When people watch&nbsp;Barmageddon, that’s your ticket to have the most fun you could ever imagine on TV,” Daly said.</p><p>Joining the star-studded contestants is Shelton’s wife Gwen Stefani who will compete against Sheryl Crow. Brie Bella and Sasha Banks are taking a step away from the WWE stage, this time to Shelton’s bar in Nashville. Other contestants include actor Lil Rel Howery, Tennessee Titans coach Mike Vrabel, country music singer Chris Young and many more.</p><p>In the first look <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">teaser</a>, Daly explains that if a celebrity loses a game, they then have a chance to spin the Wheel of Redemption. Written on the wheel are challenges that the losing contestant can do to return to the game.</p><p>Also seen in the clip are onstage singing performances by Crow and Stefani with Shelton also doing sing-alongs with Ole Red’s Band. Barmageddon premieres on Monday, December 5 on the USA Network.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Carson Daly is Feeling 18 Again After Successful Back Surgery</h2><p>Two decades of chronic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">back pain</a> have seemingly come to an end after undergoing a successful back surgery seven weeks ago. Daly underwent the same surgery that professional golfer Tiger Woods did five years ago, having an intervertebral disc removed and replaced with a spacer.</p><p>Daly has recently returned to the Today show where he reveals he’s feeling great now. He also reveals his plans of documenting a story about his experience while talking about how he’s in the best shape of his life.</p><p>“I’m 18 again,” Daly said. “It’s been quite the recovery. I had some time to sit around and [rest], but it feels great.”</p><p>He then added that there’s still a long road ahead to making a complete recovery. Going on regular walks has certainly worked for the broadcaster as part of his recovery. Viewers can then expect Daly to be in top shape with his future projects.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_CarrieUnderwood_Denise-TruscelloGetty-Images-for-CMT.jpg alt="Why Carrie Underwood Says It’s Important for Her to Sound Good in Concert" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xrCcp2WjqbKnrc2iZJuqmZp6o7HLpZhmmZ2ku6h5x6KeoWWgp7yntcueZJydnJqvs7XTopysZZmjeqOt0aaYoJ2UmbyvecWiqaysXaG8sLeO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
