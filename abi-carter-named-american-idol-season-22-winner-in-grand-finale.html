She beat out fellow Top 3 singers Will Moseley and Jack Blocker. The episode also paid tribute to judge Katy Perry, who is leaving the show after seven seasons.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-abi-carter-named-american-idol-season-22-winner>Abi Carter Named American Idol Season 22 Winner</h2><p>Abi Carter started Season 22 as a Platinum Ticket recipient following her audition to “What Was I Made For?” by Billie Eilish. She made it all the way to the finale, where she was named the winner of Season 22. Will Moseley finished in second place, and Jack Blocker in third.</p><p>Throughout Sunday’s show, Abi delivered several performances. That includes covers of “Bed of Roses” by guest mentor Bon Jovi, as well as “Somewhere” from West Side Story for her hometown of Indio, California. She also sang her new original single “This Isn’t Over,” recorded as part of her time on the show. Plus, Abi got to perform a powerhouse duet of “River” with Bishop Briggs.</p><p>In a heartwarming moment, Abi also received a video message from Billie Eilish herself, wishing her “nothing but the best” in the competition. Abi was so shocked by the clip, she fell to her knees on the stage. That’s also what she did when host Ryan Seacrest announced her as the winner.</p><p>When she had composed herself, Abi used her winning moment to once again perform “What Was I Made For?” Confetti rained down as she sang, and judge Katy Perry could be seen crying as she watched the emotional performance.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHY KATY PERRY CALLED HER FANS ‘TRAITORS’ DURING THIS WEEK’S ‘AMERICAN IDOL’</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-katy-perry-says-goodbye-after-seven-seasons>Katy Perry Says Goodbye After Seven Seasons</h2><p>In addition to announcing this season’s winner, the finale also paid tribute to Katy Perry, who announced earlier this year that Season 22 would be her last as a judge. To say goodbye, the ladies of the Top 12 performed a medley of Perry’s hits, including “Teenage Dream” and “California Gurls.” Perry responded by standing on the judges’ table.</p><p>Perry also paid tribute to the singers she’s met over the past seven seasons during a duet with Top 3 contestant Jack Blocker. The pair performed Perry’s song “What Makes a Woman.” As she sang, Perry rose above the stage to show off her long gown. The skirt featured pictures of past American Idol Top 24 contestants.</p><p>“It was just going to be a pretty skirt with a silver top and I was like, ‘No, let’s do something. Let’s make a moment. Let’s pay homage to all the contestants,'” Perry <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">later said</a> of the skirt. “It was just to show how much these kids have really lifted me up.”</p><p>Sunday’s finale also featured appearances from past Idol winners Nick Fradiani and Fantasia Barrino, as well as Wynonna, Hootie & the Blowfish, Jason Mraz, and New Kids on the Block. Judges Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan also took the stage on Sunday night.</p><p>What do you think of the American Idol Season 22 results? Were you rooting for Abi Carter to win?
