If any of the Products is finally held to so infringe, or in Morning Consult’s sole reasonable judgment is likely to be so held, Morning Consult will, at its option and expense: (i) procure for you the right to continue using the applicable Product, (ii) modify or replace the applicable Product to make it non-infringing as long as such Product, as modified or replaced, has the same functionality in all material respects, or (iii) terminate the applicable subscription and provide you a pro rata refund of any pre-paid fees applicable to such Product for the period after termination. Notwithstanding the above, Morning Consult will have no obligations under this Section 6(a) or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim arising out of: (A) use of other than a current, unaltered Release of the Products unless the infringing portion is also in the then current Release, (B) any use of the Products in combination with products, equipment, software, or data not made available hereunder by Morning Consult if the infringement was caused by such use or combination, (C) any use, modification, or derivation of the Products not specifically authorized in writing by Morning Consult or expressly permitted under this Agreement, or (D) Customer’s negligence or willful misconduct (including the negligence or willful misconduct of any person acting on behalf of a Customer). <strong>THE FOREGOING STATES MORNING CONSULT’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ALL THIRD PARTY CLAIMS</strong>.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">(b) <strong><span class=underline>By Customer</span></strong>.
