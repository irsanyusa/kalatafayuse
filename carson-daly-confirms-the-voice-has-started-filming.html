As he wrote in the caption, “My first day ever shooting @nbcthevoice without @blakeshelton.”</p><p>Daly went on to explain that he and longtime coach Shelton “had a ritual of getting hair & makeup together for 23 seasons.” He ended the post by writing, “I think I’m handling it well. Everything’s fine.”</p><p>Shelton left The Voice after the most recent season, having coached on the show since its inception.
