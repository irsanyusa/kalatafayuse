She has more than 3.7 million people following her Instagram account. In 2015, she started a curious experiment with a goal of showing how the most popular photos and videos would look if instead of celebrities, average people had created them. The project has become so successful that now, Celeste is traveling around Australia and the US and is sharing the stories behind her photos and telling about her relationship with the celebrities she was copying. Her husband helps her with this project by assisting her and generating ideas. Among Celeste and her spouse's fans, there are such celebrities as Robbie Williams, Ashton Kutcher, Cindy Crawford, and Kris Jenner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afLWtxqxmpKqZqHqrsc2nnKtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
