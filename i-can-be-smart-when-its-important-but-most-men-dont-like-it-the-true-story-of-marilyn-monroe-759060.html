There were more than 400 books in&nbsp;her library.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce6/314/95266a57bba547e89f6be59d4c.jpg><p>Marilyn didn’t get a&nbsp;formal <a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child or&nbsp;a&nbsp;young adult, and that’s why she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>became</a> a&nbsp;great book-lover in&nbsp;her adult life. There were more than 400 books in&nbsp;her library, and they included everything from fiction to&nbsp;science. The legendary blonde singled out authors like Hemingway, Flaubert, Camus, and Freud.</p><p>When one of&nbsp;the directors saw her with a&nbsp;volume of&nbsp;<i>Letters to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Young Poet </i>by&nbsp;Rilke, he&nbsp;asked why she chose this book. Marilyn <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>replied</a>, <strong>“[On] nights when I’ve got nothing else to&nbsp;do, I&nbsp;go to&nbsp;the Pickwick bookstore on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> Boulevard. And I&nbsp;just open books at&nbsp;random&nbsp;— and when&nbsp;I come to&nbsp;a&nbsp;page or&nbsp;a&nbsp;paragraph I&nbsp;like, I&nbsp;buy that book. So&nbsp;last night&nbsp;I bought this one. Is&nbsp;that wrong?”</strong></p><p>You can find the whole list of&nbsp;the actress’s literary preferences <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>here</a>.</p><p><h2>2. Monroe tried her best to&nbsp;perfect her acting skills despite critics’ opinions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a2/ca1/99f28653b1bc87936d834874a7.jpg><p>Marilyn wasn’t content with her roles as&nbsp;a&nbsp;charming dumb blonde that she used to&nbsp;get offered, so&nbsp;she regularly attended acting classes. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>According</a> to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her teachers&nbsp;— the legendary Lee Strasberg, Marilyn Monroe and Marlon Brando were his best students because they were the only ones who could immerse themselves deeply into the lives of&nbsp;their characters. The actress’s sense of&nbsp;purpose was also noted by&nbsp;her fellow students and other teachers.</p><p>Nevertheless, filmmakers were still not giving the actress serious roles which is&nbsp;why Marilyn was becoming the best under the conditions and the working environment that she had. Her look is&nbsp;another result of&nbsp;her hard work on&nbsp;herself. She was working out, mastering every gesture so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;looked cinematic and convincing. For example, she created a&nbsp;unique walk for the movie <i>Niagara&nbsp;</i>— no&nbsp;one ever walked <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>this way</a> before her.</p><p><h2>3. She skillfully manipulated film studio management and public opinion.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/45a/c38/6524115604aa5e58ab740a57fe.jpg><p>Monroe had a&nbsp;remarkable ability to&nbsp;avoid sharp corners and reach goals she had set. And the biographical book Goddess: The Secret Lives of&nbsp;Marilyn Monroe by&nbsp;Anthony Summers, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;many other books about the life of&nbsp;the celebrity, prove&nbsp;it.</p><ul><li>In&nbsp;1952, in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her interviews, the actress said she was photographed naked for a&nbsp;calendar. The studio was trying to&nbsp;talk her out of&nbsp;the idea of&nbsp;revealing the fact that it&nbsp;was her, but the actress didn’t listen to&nbsp;them. Finally, Marilyn embarrassingly told the public that she was too poor to&nbsp;refuse the income and this revelation brought her even more love from her fans.</li><li>Monroe had always had a&nbsp;strained relationship with the 20th Century Fox studio. The actress wanted more creative freedom and decent payment corresponding to&nbsp;her status, but she couldn’t manage to&nbsp;get what she wanted due to&nbsp;her personal dislike of&nbsp;the management. Then she decided to&nbsp;establish her own studio and started a&nbsp;self-PR campaign forcing 20th Century Fox to&nbsp;surrender and give her the contract she wanted. By&nbsp;the way, Monroe’s studio shot only one movie <a href=#>The Prince and the Showgirl</a> with Laurence Olivier.</li></ul><p><h2>4. The actress was developing in&nbsp;all scenic directions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e69/49c/46691258b6947f9c66be3236ed.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;the actress’s biography written by&nbsp;Donald Spoto, Marilyn dedicated her time not only to&nbsp;learning how to&nbsp;act, but she was also to&nbsp;dancing, singing, and yoga. Ben Lyon, an&nbsp;executive at&nbsp;20th Century Fox once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview a&nbsp;case with Monroe that showed her other side. Having learned about the actress’s hectic life schedule, he&nbsp;asked her why she worked so&nbsp;much and hard on&nbsp;herself. And that’s what Marilyn <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>answered</a>, “<strong>One day maybe an&nbsp;opportunity will knock and&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;prepared.</strong>”</p><p><h2>5. She was actively involved in&nbsp;charity.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/711/c08/b3cac65a3c8e27900905616595.jpg><p>Here is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shortlist</a> of&nbsp;the famous blonde’s good deeds:</p><ul><li>She financially supported organizations that helped orphanages and other organizations dealing with children’s problems.</li><li>She wrote a&nbsp;check for $10,000 to&nbsp;an&nbsp;orphanage during a&nbsp;visit to&nbsp;Mexico.</li><li>She bequeathed&nbsp;25% of&nbsp;her property to&nbsp;her psychologist, who was supposed to&nbsp;sponsor psychiatric hospitals.</li></ul><p><h2>6. She fought for equality in&nbsp;civil rights.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a26/d0d/a3fe0b58b8b5df88e5c65ce438.jpg><p>During one of&nbsp;her last interviews, Marilyn <a href=#>asked</a> the journalist to&nbsp;concentrate on&nbsp;things that were important to&nbsp;her and not on&nbsp;her oomph.</p><p>“What I&nbsp;really want to&nbsp;say: That what the world really needs is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real feeling of&nbsp;kinship. Everybody: stars, laborers, Negroes, Jews, Arabs. We&nbsp;are all brothers. Please don’t make me&nbsp;a&nbsp;joke. End the interview with what I&nbsp;believe.”</p><p>Ella Fitzgerald, the famous singer, suffered from racial discrimination on&nbsp;stage in&nbsp;1950. She was not allowed to&nbsp;perform at&nbsp;the famous Hollywood club “Mocambo.” Many years after Marilyn’s death, Fitzgerald <a href=#>confessed</a> in&nbsp;her interview that she owed Marilyn a&nbsp;real debt.</p><p>It&nbsp;turns out that the actress had personally gotten in&nbsp;touch with the owner of&nbsp;the club. Having threatened the owner with going to&nbsp;the press, she demanded that he&nbsp;include Fitzgerald in&nbsp;the program of&nbsp;the club’s performances. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;get him to&nbsp;agree, Monroe promised to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;front table every night, thus attracting the public to&nbsp;the club. The owner agreed and Monroe kept her promise, and afterward Ella Fitzgerald didn’t perform in&nbsp;small clubs anymore.</p><p><h2>Marilyn Monroe’s heritage</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/520/1bb/4da8a4576ab9be8dd017dc3dee.jpg><p>Many biographers agree that Marilyn’s image, that helped her conquer the world, played a&nbsp;cruel joke on&nbsp;her&nbsp;— she became its hostage. When she decided to&nbsp;change her image, she couldn’t find any support from others. The essence of&nbsp;this thought is&nbsp;well reflected in&nbsp;the words of&nbsp;the writer Sarah Churchwell, the author of&nbsp;the actress’s biography:</p><p>“The biggest myth is&nbsp;that she was dumb. The second is&nbsp;that she was fragile. The third is&nbsp;that she couldn’t act. She was far from dumb, although she was not formally educated, and she was very sensitive about that. But she was very smart indeed&nbsp;— and very tough. She had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;both to&nbsp;beat the Hollywood studio system in&nbsp;the 1950s. The head of&nbsp;Fox Studios was incredibly contemptuous of&nbsp;her, and she fought him tooth and nail, and won, in&nbsp;real terms. She was very witty, with an&nbsp;acidic sense of&nbsp;humor. The dumb blonde was a&nbsp;role&nbsp;— she was an&nbsp;actress, for heaven’s sake! Such a&nbsp;good actress that no&nbsp;one now believes she was anything but what she portrayed on&nbsp;screen.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a38/7a3/7194045d89b06f7cf7e9e48353.jpg><p>And here is&nbsp;what Marilyn herself would say about it&nbsp;via her heroine Lorelei:</p><p>“I&nbsp;can be&nbsp;smart when it’s important, but most men don’t like&nbsp;it.”</p><p><h2>Bonus: Materials that will help you get to&nbsp;know the actress better</h2></p><p><strong>Books:</strong></p><p><strong>Documentaries:</strong></p><p>What’s your attitude toward the famous actress?
