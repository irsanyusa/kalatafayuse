Hence, it’s not surprising that there’s more than one way to say goodbye in Swiss German.&nbsp;</p><p>In this guide, we’ll review seven common ways to say goodbye in Swiss German.

Ade/Adje/Adieu"><a href=#>Ade/Adje/Adieu</a></li><li><a href=#>Uf Widerluege!</a></li><li><a href=#>Bis schpöter!/Bis schpäter!</a></li><li><a href=#>Schöne Tag!</a></li><li><a href=#>Tschau</a></li><li><a href=#>Mach’s guet!</a></li><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-Tschüss>1. Tschüss</h2><p>Tschüss is Standard German for “bye” and is widely used in German-speaking countries. Since German is one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">four official languages</a> in Switzerland, it’s not surprising that Tschüss is fairly common throughout Switzerland.&nbsp;</p><p>You can use Tschüss in any kind of situation, whether you’re leaving the office in the evening or parting ways with your friends after a night out.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-‘Ade’/‘Adje’/‘Adieu’>2. Ade/Adje/Adieu</h2><p>Depending on where you are in Switzerland, you may hear people bidding each other farewell with Ade or Adje. These words are versions of the French adieu, which is not limited to the French parts of Switzerland but is also frequently used by Swiss German speakers.</p><p>As with Tschüss, you can use any of the three in either formal or informal settings.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Uf-Widerluege!’>3. Uf Widerluege!</h2><p>Uf Widerluege can loosely be translated as, “I hope to see you again!”. It’s another Swiss German all-rounder, appropriate for any manner of setting and situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, it may sound slightly more formal than a quick Ade or Tschüss, but it’s still a solid option when saying goodbye to friends or colleagues.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Bis-schpöter/Bis-schpäter!>4. Bis schpöter/Bis schpäter!</h2><p>Not every goodbye means forever. If you’re planning to meet up again later, you can use Bis schpöter! (“See you later!”). Depending on the variation of Swiss German dialect, be prepared to hear it pronounced differently. Some pronounce it schp<strong>ö</strong>ter, others schp<strong>ä</strong>ter.&nbsp;</p><p>You can use this phrase in most settings, so long as you’re expecting to meet someone again later that day.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Schöne-Tag!>5. Schöne Tag!</h2><p>Make someone’s day and wish them a hearty Schöne Tag! upon their departure. This friendly phrase translates to “Good day!”.&nbsp;</p><p>This one’s useful if you’re unsure whether the setting calls for something informal or formal.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6.-Tschau>6. Tschau</h2><p>Did we mention that Swiss German has major German, French and Italian influences? We already talked about Tschüss (German) and adieu (French), so here comes Tschau — derived from the classic Italian farewell ciao.&nbsp;</p><p>While the other two are universal, Tschau is more suitable for informal settings and might earn you some raised eyebrows when used in the workplace.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7.-Mach’s-guet!>7. Mach’s guet!</h2><p>You can use Mach’s guet! to show people that you care for their continued welfare. It’s a bit more intimate than a short Tschau or Ade and means as much as “Take good care!” or “Have a good rest of your day!”.&nbsp;</p><p>This phrase should generally be reserved for people you’re familiar with. In a professional context, Mach’s guet doesn’t sound quite formal enough. If you’re addressing more than one person, address them with Machet’s guet! (the plural version).&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>&nbsp;Ade, Tschau and Tschüss! Context is everything</h2><p>Goodbye is one of the most <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">important phrases</a> to learn if you intend to communicate with native speakers. Fortunately, there are many ways to say goodbye in Swiss German.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of them, like Ade or Tschau, demonstrate the rich linguistic culture of Switzerland with their apparent French and Italian influences. Just be careful: while most of the phrases above can be used in any type of environment, there are some exceptions (like Tschau and Mach’s guet!) that are more suitable for informal situations.&nbsp;</p><p>To get a feeling for the Swiss German language and Swiss culture, speaking the language regularly is essential. A <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">language course</a> with a Swiss German teacher can help you gain a better understanding of the Swiss German dialects and how their uses differ.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lea-Hauke-Foto-1-1.jpg><h2>Lea Hauke</h2><p>Lea is a writer and translator for English and German and lives in Austria.
