I had a first date scheduled with a woman I met on a dating site. We agreed to meet for coffee at 2 pm. I arrived on time. At 2:10, she texted me and asked if I was at the cafe. I said yes, and she said she was at home but would leave soon and be there in 20 minutes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I&nbsp;was put off. I&nbsp;took the risk she wouldn’t show up&nbsp;and came on&nbsp;time. She should have&nbsp;to.

She still wasn’t there. At&nbsp;2:45, I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;text from her wanting to&nbsp;know where I&nbsp;was. I&nbsp;said, “I&nbsp;finished my&nbsp;coffee and left at&nbsp;2:30 when you still weren’t there as&nbsp;promised.” She sent a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;nasty texts telling me&nbsp;how awful&nbsp;I was and how&nbsp;I did everything wrong.

It&nbsp;sure seemed like it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;game or&nbsp;test. Either way, she failed my&nbsp;tests. I’d sure like to&nbsp;hear from the women on&nbsp;this one.</p><p><h2>People stood on&nbsp;his side.</h2></p><ul><li>“I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;woman. She was out of&nbsp;line to&nbsp;think anyone would wait over 15&nbsp;minutes for her. If&nbsp;her car broke down or&nbsp;had another emergency, that would be&nbsp;understandable, but this is&nbsp;just plain rude.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Far-Juggernaut8880&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“It’s one thing to&nbsp;text and say ‘I’m sorry I’m running late’ and then arrive at&nbsp;a&nbsp;reasonable time (10&nbsp;to&nbsp;15&nbsp;minutes late). It’s completely different, to&nbsp;text twice and show up&nbsp;45&nbsp;minutes late. You gave her more than a&nbsp;reasonable amount of&nbsp;time to&nbsp;show&nbsp;up.<br>She didn’t apologize. Her response was out of&nbsp;line, sending you nasty texts blaming you for doing things wrong. She sounds entitled.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>No-Alarm-2208&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Yeah, and this doesn’t have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with gender, just about being a&nbsp;rude person.

You were on&nbsp;time. She deliberately wasted your time. Hold your head high. The fault is&nbsp;all with her.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>imnotk8&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“I&nbsp;would have downed the coffee and replied with a&nbsp;‘Don’t bother, I’m leaving’ the second&nbsp;I read she hadn’t even left the house. The absolute audacity of&nbsp;the woman.

Absolutely no respect for other people’s time. If she were more polite and apologized sincerely, then the guy would not have left without notice. Serves her right!</p><ul><li>“She is&nbsp;out of&nbsp;her mind, thinking she has any room or&nbsp;right to&nbsp;say you’re in&nbsp;the wrong. I’m mind blown she would tell you she hadn’t even left the house like that’s not embarrassing. She managed to&nbsp;save you a&nbsp;LOT of&nbsp;time by&nbsp;wasting your time on&nbsp;that first date, though. Better to&nbsp;find out early what she’s like.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>SkilletKitten&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“I’m a&nbsp;woman and&nbsp;I would have left too. People who are chronically late are selfish because they think no&nbsp;one else’s time matters.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Caspian4136&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Embarrassed to&nbsp;say I&nbsp;am chronically late, but&nbsp;I always give as&nbsp;much notice as&nbsp;possible. Like if&nbsp;I know I&nbsp;am going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;15&nbsp;min before the time, I&nbsp;will tell you then. Not as&nbsp;considerate as&nbsp;being on&nbsp;time, but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;progress.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mnth241&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>In&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;relationships, decisions are rarely black and white; they often reside in&nbsp;gloomy shades of&nbsp;gray.
