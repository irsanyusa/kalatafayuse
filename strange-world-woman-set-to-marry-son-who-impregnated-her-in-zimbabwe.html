Now you see that my son is working and you accuse me of doing something wrong. Let me enjoy the products of my sweat.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Farai too told the court he is in love with his mother and is more than prepared to marry her.</p><p>“I know my father died before he finished paying the bride price and I am prepared to pay it off. It is better to publicise what is happening because people should know that I am the one who made my mother pregnant, otherwise they will accuse her of promiscuity,” he reportedly said.</p><p>The local headman, <strong>Nathan Muputirwa</strong>, lamented the situation, saying that in the past, the incestuous mother and son would be killed:</p><p>“We cannot allow this to happen in our village. This is a bad omen indeed. In the past they would have to be killed but today we cannot do it because we are afraid of the police.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02iqraqRo7SmedaoqaWcXay8rq3NZqqerF2pvG65wKupsmWjpLtuw8eoZKKloKeyqLrArZydZZiav261zWaxoqWSlq%2B4sY6yn52bpmy9</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
