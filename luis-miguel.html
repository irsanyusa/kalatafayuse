Known as "El Sol de Mexico," Luis Miguel has been recognized for his contributions across various musical genres, including pop, ballads, boleros, tangos, jazz, big band, and mariachi. He has won multiple Grammy and Latin Grammy Awards, sold around 60 million records worldwide, and has established a record-breaking legacy as a live performer.</p><p>At the age of 11, Luis Miguel released his first album, Un Sol, which began his musical career and won him a gold disc. He quickly rose to stardom, and by 14, he became one of the youngest Grammy winners in history for his duet "Me Gustas Tal Como Eres" with Sheena Easton. His albums Romance (1991) and Segundo Romance (1994) were instrumental in reviving the bolero genre and solidifying his status in Latin music.</p><p>Throughout his career, Luis Miguel has achieved numerous milestones, including several successful albums such as Aries (1993), Romances (1997), and Amarte Es un Placer (1999). He chose to sing exclusively in Spanish, forgoing a crossover to the Anglo market during the Latin Explosion of the 1990s. His touring record is impressive, marked by the "Luis Miguel Tour," and he is the highest-grossing Latin touring artist.</p><p>Luis Miguel's private life, including his relationships and family affairs, has been a subject of public intrigue. His mother's disappearance and his difficult relationship with his father have been parts of his personal narrative. Despite his early fame and other pressures, he managed a successful transition from child star to adult celebrity. Rarely giving interviews or attending award ceremonies, he has cultivated a private persona.</p><p>As of 2020, Luis Miguel ranks second on Billboard's Greatest of All-Time Latin Artists chart. His influence was further solidified by the Telemundo and Netflix biopic series covering his life, bringing his story to new audiences. His latest album, ¡México Por Siempre! (2017), continues his tradition of highlighting Mexican music.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>April 19</a>, <a href=#>1970</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> San Juan, Puerto Rico<br><b>Age: <a href=#>54 years old</a></b></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Generation X</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Dog</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Aries</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Singers</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwuNSiqmalmZzCprg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
