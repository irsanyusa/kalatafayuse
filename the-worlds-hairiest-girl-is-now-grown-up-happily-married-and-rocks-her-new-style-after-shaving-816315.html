Usually, when a&nbsp;new <a href=# title=baby data-link=tag>baby</a> is&nbsp;born, parents feel really happy and excited. That’s how Supatra’s mom and dad, Sompon and Samrerng, felt when she was born.</p><p>But their happiness was mixed with surprise, fear, and disbelief because the <a href=# title=doctor data-link=tag>doctor</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a> them their baby had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;hair. At&nbsp;first, they thought it&nbsp;was normal, but when they saw her in&nbsp;the incubator, they were shocked by&nbsp;how much hair she had. Supatra’s hair covered almost her whole body, and even the doctors in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Thailand data-link=tag>Thailand</a> had never seen someone like her.</p><p>Later&nbsp;on, doctors figured out that Natty had a&nbsp;very rare skin disease called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ambras syndrome</a>. This condition is&nbsp;so&nbsp;uncommon that there have only been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>50&nbsp;cases</a> like hers documented in&nbsp;the world since a&nbsp;long time ago.</p><p><h2>Ambras syndrome causes excess body hair growth, sparing only the palms, soles, and mouth interior, likely due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden DNA change.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c4a/213/89ddeb5749a7ce0c1fe5c3a6ac.jpg><p>When Natty was born, and her mom wanted to&nbsp;leave the <a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a>, the doctors didn’t want to&nbsp;let her go&nbsp;because they were worried she might leave her child behind. Sompon told the doctor that she would never abandon her child, no&nbsp;matter what. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, <strong>“We&nbsp;are lucky that she was born into our family.”</strong></p><p>Natty grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving family, but not everyone was understanding of&nbsp;her condition, and she had to&nbsp;deal with some unkindness from strangers and peers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dae/8e0/b13d9752bd938f046784229577.jpg><p>As&nbsp;Natty grew&nbsp;up, her face remained hidden behind thick hair due to&nbsp;her incurable Ambras syndrome. Regular methods like laser removal couldn’t slow down her hair growth. At&nbsp;<a href=# title=school data-link=tag>school</a>, she faced ridicule because of&nbsp;her unique appearance. Kids called her names like “wolf girl” and “monkey face.”</p><p>Natty, however, didn’t understand why they teased her, as&nbsp;she considered herself a&nbsp;normal girl with just a&nbsp;bit more hair. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>, <strong>“It’s the way I&nbsp;am.”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/722/ef4/4ff519557c9d11fbd4834ddfd1.jpg><p>Natty’s teacher, Kuljira Posaeng, revealed that other kids were initially scared of&nbsp;Natty’s appearance, making her early school days difficult. Over time, though, Natty proved she was just like any other student. Teachers described her as&nbsp;hardworking with good grades, and she eventually became one of&nbsp;the most popular kids at&nbsp;school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d26/6ad/a7372d5333ba2fe1572f284e87.jpg><p>Natty’s teachers said she was a&nbsp;lively girl who loved to&nbsp;sing, dance, and act. Her parents treated her just like any other kid, and they never made her feel like she was less important. They took her everywhere and <strong>weren’t embarrassed that she looked different from other children.</strong></p><p><h2>Later on, Natty found her love.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e18/138/9644a157cc9f1790233b9bd426.jpg><p>Natty has come to&nbsp;terms with her condition, understanding that there’s no&nbsp;cure for&nbsp;it. She decided to&nbsp;keep her body hair the way it&nbsp;naturally grew from the time she was born, only shaving her face when she became a&nbsp;teenager. As&nbsp;she grew older, her self-esteem and self-image became more important to&nbsp;her, and she also found love.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>: “It&nbsp;began from friendship, then we&nbsp;became a&nbsp;couple.” Their conversations brought her happiness, and being together was comfortable, with a&nbsp;love she didn’t anticipate: “<strong>It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;love that&nbsp;I didn’t expect would happen to&nbsp;me</strong>.”</p><p><h2>Natty later married her boyfriend, calling him “the love of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3f7/b50/f7e5905c29985a0db03aca22a4.jpg><p>She also posted pictures with her lover, showing her face without facial hair. Some people thought she might have been cured, but her dad explained that she had chosen to&nbsp;shave her facial hair to&nbsp;reveal her new look. Now, her eyes, face, mouth, lips, and cheeks are visible, with only her forehead covered by&nbsp;her head’s hair.</p><p>Natty, who has found love and happiness, is&nbsp;determined to&nbsp;lead a&nbsp;positive life and continue making a&nbsp;beautiful impact on&nbsp;society. She believes that everyone is&nbsp;beautiful and unique in&nbsp;their own way, and she wants to&nbsp;inspire others to&nbsp;embrace their individuality and radiate their inner beauty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8bc/212/3bb7f55e9fb6e06d1ac51168b1.jpg><p>Before you&nbsp;go, be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;check out another article where a&nbsp;woman shares her story to&nbsp;emphasize that <a href=#><strong>body hair shouldn’t be&nbsp;criticized</strong></a>, highlighting the importance of&nbsp;self-acceptance and embracing one’s uniqueness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYywpquklKh6qa3Iq6Ceq6RitKq%2By2agrGWepMRus9GorqdlpaV6qa3PqaClsV2irrO%2ByJ6bZpmemXqzu8Kkqmaglad6r7HWZqqtsZyaeqKy056pZquYlsOqusZmb2puY2aCcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
