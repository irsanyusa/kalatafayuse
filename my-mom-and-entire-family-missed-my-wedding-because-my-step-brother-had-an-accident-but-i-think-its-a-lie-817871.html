I’m 23. Anyway, I&nbsp;got married a&nbsp;month ago, and it&nbsp;was nice, but my&nbsp;mom’s <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> did not attend. I&nbsp;was devastated, but my&nbsp;dad’s side and everyone else made up&nbsp;for&nbsp;it.</p><p>When my&nbsp;mom finally contacted&nbsp;me (the night after) she told me&nbsp;that Jack had gotten into an&nbsp;accident a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;nights before (he&nbsp;was with an&nbsp;older friend of&nbsp;his who crashed the car). He’s physically fine but was pretty spooked and refused to&nbsp;get into the car, but they couldn’t leave him alone because they were worried. Mom said she was going to&nbsp;come by&nbsp;herself or&nbsp;with my&nbsp;step-siblings, but then there was an&nbsp;issue with the car, which was caused by&nbsp;Jack freaking out when they were first getting ready to&nbsp;leave.</p><p>She then said she was going to&nbsp;call an&nbsp;Uber to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the wedding, but Jack had passed out from the stress, so&nbsp;she couldn’t leave because she was terrified something happened to&nbsp;him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/335/ec8/841c7a5498a6559700e3c8cb8d.jpg><p>I&nbsp;understand, but if&nbsp;I’m being honest, I&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;I believe my&nbsp;mom 100%. She sounded pretty apologetic, but I’m still upset that no&nbsp;one let me&nbsp;know.</p><p>Apart from my&nbsp;mom, Jack, and my&nbsp;step-dad who might’ve been way too preoccupied, my&nbsp;step-siblings are all over 16&nbsp;years old with phones of&nbsp;their own. Couldn’t they have told&nbsp;me?</p><p>My&nbsp;mom asked me&nbsp;if&nbsp;we&nbsp;could meet, but&nbsp;I honestly didn’t want to&nbsp;see her at&nbsp;that moment. Though her absence was valid, she’s never at&nbsp;any of&nbsp;my&nbsp;big events because of&nbsp;Jack. It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;pure coincidence, but&nbsp;I just didn’t want to&nbsp;see her. I&nbsp;was and am&nbsp;still upset.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b6/c87/218f4752e8abd19d33109ec49a.jpg><p>My&nbsp;mom was annoyed by&nbsp;this and told me&nbsp;the world doesn’t revolve around me&nbsp;and&nbsp;I have no&nbsp;right to&nbsp;be&nbsp;upset over her not being there now that&nbsp;I know why. I&nbsp;told her that&nbsp;I didn’t care, I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;see her. In&nbsp;fact, I’m very angry at&nbsp;her. She told me&nbsp;that&nbsp;I was being selfish and that she wouldn’t be&nbsp;contacting me&nbsp;anymore until&nbsp;I apologized because she could not handle my&nbsp;childish tantrums on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;everything else.</p><p>I&nbsp;don’t know. I&nbsp;think&nbsp;I should’ve just said okay and met up&nbsp;with her, but I’m hurt. She still hasn’t talked to&nbsp;me&nbsp;though, and she usually doesn’t go&nbsp;through with her threats. Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;wrong?</p><p><h2>And then added crucial information.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c48/6a3/1039a25e1b96545200dcbccec1.jpg><p>She missed my&nbsp;high school graduation, two birthdays, and a&nbsp;few mom-daughter dates because Jack was either sick, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;mood, «missing», etc. I&nbsp;never said much because he&nbsp;was still a&nbsp;kid then. But this was kind of&nbsp;like... the straw that broke the camel’s back.</p><p><h2>People defended her.</h2></p><ul><li>«At&nbsp;this point, frankly, why would you want to&nbsp;meet up&nbsp;with your mother? You know what she’s going to&nbsp;say, she’ll just be&nbsp;defensive and tell you you have no&nbsp;right to&nbsp;your feelings.<br>And what would you say to&nbsp;her? Would it&nbsp;improve your relationship? She can’t make up&nbsp;for missing your wedding, that ship has sailed.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>F**OrF**-1999&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«You’re going to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;make peace that your mom is&nbsp;who she&nbsp;is, her priorities are what they are and to&nbsp;not expect anything to&nbsp;shift.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>My_Poor_Nerves&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«You should match her mom’s energy. Miss dates, other big events, especially Jack’s. Is&nbsp;that petty?

She’s repeatedly picked Jack over you and any one of&nbsp;those times may have been fine, but as&nbsp;a&nbsp;collective whole, it’s unacceptable. You deserve people who love you, support you, and show up&nbsp;for you.<br>Those who don’t, don’t deserve your time.

I&nbsp;don’t think she ever tried to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;your wedding. And her putting in&nbsp;the effort to&nbsp;still attend but then just never thought to&nbsp;reach out to&nbsp;you before the wedding took place makes ZERO sense.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Alarmed_Jellyfish555&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«Where’s stepdad in&nbsp;all of&nbsp;this? Why can’t he&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;the situation? A&nbsp;mom should feel a&nbsp;STRONG obligation to&nbsp;be&nbsp;at&nbsp;these big events. Even if&nbsp;she Ubered there, told the guy to&nbsp;wait a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;minutes while she ran&nbsp;in, explained, said her congrats and&nbsp;I love you, and get back in&nbsp;the Uber and get back to&nbsp;Jack if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was that bad.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sweetpotato_latte&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c75/c6d/00f4005758b5a4575fd17e1b6c.jpg><ul><li>«I&nbsp;would’ve freaked out if&nbsp;my&nbsp;family just didn’t show up&nbsp;on&nbsp;my&nbsp;wedding day without a&nbsp;word.

There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;excuse for just ghosting you on&nbsp;your wedding day, and you have every right to&nbsp;feel hurt and upset.

You have a&nbsp;right to&nbsp;be&nbsp;angry or&nbsp;upset about&nbsp;it, and your mother doesn’t get to&nbsp;dictate how you feel. You two need to&nbsp;sit down and hash this out. Your mom sounds really defensive, so&nbsp;I don’t really have high hopes, but she at&nbsp;least needs to&nbsp;hear you out.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Regular_Boot_3540&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>While doubts may have initially clouded her perception, they can also lead her to&nbsp;a&nbsp;deeper understanding of&nbsp;the <a href=#>complexities of&nbsp;family life</a>.
