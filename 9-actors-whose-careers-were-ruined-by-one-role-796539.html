To&nbsp;make the more famous directors invite them to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;their films, actors have to&nbsp;work with little-known directors first. But sometimes it&nbsp;happens that after several successful films, an&nbsp;actor takes part in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=movie data-link=tag>movie</a> that gets bad reviews, and it&nbsp;becomes a&nbsp;stain on&nbsp;their reputation. And not all of&nbsp;the actors have managed to&nbsp;get out from under this mistake.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> came up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;actors whose <a href=# title=careers data-link=tag>careers</a> went downhill after a&nbsp;bad role.</p><p><h2>Demi Moore&nbsp;— G.I. Jane</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ebd/22c/2729d35fb7a8b7dd618eff00b6.jpg><p>The movie <a href=#>Ghost</a> was released in&nbsp;1990 and it&nbsp;not only made Demi famous, but it&nbsp;also brought her a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;film awards and numerous invitations to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;other projects. But in&nbsp;1996, the movie <a href=#>Striptease</a> was released and it&nbsp;was poorly received by&nbsp;the audience and the critics. <a href=# title="Demi Moore" data-link=tag>Demi Moore</a> got the <a href=#>Golden Raspberry Award </a>for her role as&nbsp;Erin Grant.</p><p>But Demi’s role in&nbsp;an&nbsp;action film called <a href=#>G.I. Jane</a> put an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;Moore’s promising career in&nbsp;acting. Taking part in&nbsp;this movie brought her another <a href=#>award</a> for worst actress. But Demi shares that G.I. Jane is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her favorite films and that this project was underrated. Demi <a href=#>said</a> in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her interviews: “It&nbsp;was that kind of&nbsp;criticism that really sent me&nbsp;into a&nbsp;space where&nbsp;I lost a&nbsp;little bit of&nbsp;passion and that maybe disheartened&nbsp;me.” And one of&nbsp;the studio executives <a href=#>shared</a>: “People just don’t want to&nbsp;see her. We&nbsp;would have to&nbsp;drag them kicking and screaming to&nbsp;see this movie.”</p><p><h2>Lindsay Lohan&nbsp;— I&nbsp;Know Who Killed&nbsp;Me</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/491/5aa/77284c5447992a18b71eb78270.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 1990s and the beginning of&nbsp;the 2000s, <a href=# title="Lindsay Lohan" data-link=tag>Lindsay Lohan</a> was one of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>’s most sought-after young actresses, who was expected to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;great future. But in&nbsp;2007, a&nbsp;low-budget horror film called <a href=#>I&nbsp;Know Who Killed Me&nbsp;</a>was released where absolutely everything starting from the script to&nbsp;the acting was bad. And at&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;filming, Lohan was treated for numerous addictions and was often late or&nbsp;didn’t appear on&nbsp;the film set at&nbsp;all which also negatively affected the directors’ desire to&nbsp;work with her.</p><p>The movie I&nbsp;Know Who Killed Me&nbsp;was a&nbsp;complete disappointment, not only for the critics and the audience, but for the actress herself. When one of&nbsp;her Twitter subscribers wrote that he&nbsp;watched the movie 2&nbsp;times in&nbsp;one night, Lindsay even<a href=#> replied</a>: “two times too many!”</p><p><h2>Elizabeth Berkley&nbsp;— Showgirls</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c04/059/cc5a3f535ba93c89507a89725d.jpg><p>The movie <a href=#>Showgirls</a> was released in&nbsp;1995. It&nbsp;got a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;negative reviews from both critics and audiences almost right after the premiere and won a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;the <a href=#>Golden Raspberry Awards</a>. Elizabeth Berkley was also criticized for her obviously bad acting.</p><p>Besides, her fans couldn’t cope with her sudden change of&nbsp;role. The actress had been <a href=#>part</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pretty popular sitcom for teenagers for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years before she took part in&nbsp;Paul Verhoeven’s movie. This new negative fame had a&nbsp;harmful influence on&nbsp;Elizabeth’s career and directors started declining to&nbsp;work with her. After Showgirls was released, even Elizabeth’s agent <a href=#>refused</a> to&nbsp;work with her.</p><p><h2>Geena Davis&nbsp;— Cutthroat Island</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e6a/bd6/345ae25b6a8286426cccaf7944.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1991, Geena Davis took part in&nbsp;the movie <a href=#>Thelma &&nbsp;Louise </a>and won several awards for this role. But 4&nbsp;years later, the movie <a href=#>Cutthroat Island</a> was released and Geena’s career went downhill. With a&nbsp;budget of&nbsp;$98&nbsp;million, the box office only made <a href=#>$10 million</a> and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;disaster.</p><p>Such a&nbsp;major failure couldn’t be&nbsp;forgiven, regardless of&nbsp;her work in&nbsp;Thelma and Louise, so&nbsp;after Cutthroat Island, Geena never had another big role.</p><p><h2>Chris Klein&nbsp;— Rollerball</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af2/6af/9203e3504d9cc7bafcabf8a442.jpg><p>The handsome athlete named&nbsp;Oz from the movie <a href=#>American Pie</a> made the audience fall in&nbsp;love with him. At&nbsp;this point actor, Chris Klein, with his second big role, became popular. A&nbsp;year after the second part of&nbsp;the American Pie franchise, Chris took part in&nbsp;<a href=#>Rollerball</a>, a&nbsp;remake of&nbsp;the 1975 film with the same name. The film received terrible <a href=#>reviews</a> from viewers and critics, and Klein’s career, which had just begun, instantly collapsed.</p><p><h2>Jennifer Lopez&nbsp;— Gigli</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/158/960/785e425798b726993cc6ffedc1.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;viewers and critics, the movie <a href=#>Gigli </a>became the worst one in&nbsp;<a href=# title="Ben Affleck" data-link=tag>Ben Affleck</a>’s career. He&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;restore his reputation as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor, but Jennifer Lopez failed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the same. Despite the fact that before taking part in&nbsp;this disastrous movie, she had been nominated for a&nbsp;<a href=#>Golden Globe Award</a> for her role in&nbsp;<a href=#>Selena</a>, <a href=#>Gigli</a> put an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;her acting career. But now, most people know Lopez as&nbsp;a&nbsp;singer and not an&nbsp;actress anyway, and she’s perfect for this role.</p><p>This movie also destroyed <a href=#>Martin Brest’s</a> career who directed <a href=#>Scent of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Woman</a>, that got Al&nbsp;Pacino an&nbsp;Oscar award, before working on&nbsp;Gigli. After this epic disaster, Brest had to&nbsp;quit.</p><p><h2>John Travolta&nbsp;— Battlefield Earth</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dcf/a52/5a888d58ec920fb93c50c6f04e.jpg><p>John Travolta’s career is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;ups and downs. The movie <a href=#>Grease</a>, that was released at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 1970s, made him famous, but after that, he&nbsp;only took part in&nbsp;little-known films until Tarantino offered him a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;the legendary <a href=#>Pulp Fiction</a>. In&nbsp;2000, Travolta directed <a href=#>Battlefield Earth</a> and played the main role in&nbsp;it. This movie became a&nbsp;leader in&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;<a href=#>Golden Raspberry Awards</a> and the amount of&nbsp;negative <a href=#>reviews</a>, and of&nbsp;the $70 million invested in&nbsp;this film, the result didn’t even pay off by&nbsp;half.</p><p><h2>Jennifer Love Hewitt&nbsp;— Jewtopia</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c4f/94d/98226755c38f5507f787d06774.jpg><p>From the beginning of&nbsp;the 1990s, to&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 2000s, Jennifer Love Hewitt took part in&nbsp;many films, but it&nbsp;was the youth thriller <a href=#>I&nbsp;Know What You Did Last Summer</a> and its sequel that made her really famous. In&nbsp;2013, <a href=#>Jewtopia</a>, a&nbsp;movie that was based on&nbsp;the Broadway play with the same name, was released. This movie wasn’t popular and got negative reviews from the audience because of&nbsp;the stereotypical characters and a&nbsp;large number of&nbsp;silly jokes. After that movie, Love Hewitt almost never took part in&nbsp;big projects and now we&nbsp;only get to&nbsp;see her in&nbsp;TV series.</p><p><h2>Neve Campbell&nbsp;— Wild Things</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b8/29a/ddadeb52a1a3c24398e89ae8fe.jpg><p>The American-Canadian actress, Neve Campbell, is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the actresses who are called <a href=#>scream queens</a>. She became famous thanks to&nbsp;her role in&nbsp;the movie<a href=#> Scream</a>. She played Sidney Prescott, a&nbsp;girl who managed to&nbsp;escape from the killer Ghostface in&nbsp;each one of&nbsp;the 4&nbsp;movies. But in&nbsp;1998, the actress decided to&nbsp;try something new and took part in&nbsp;the erotic thriller <a href=#>Wild Things</a>. Despite the fact that the audience’s reaction to&nbsp;the film was generally quite positive, it&nbsp;failed at&nbsp;<a href=#>the box office</a>, and Neve’s image in&nbsp;the film, which was very far from her positive character in&nbsp;Scream, no&nbsp;longer seemed appealing to&nbsp;her fans.</p><p>Except for the third and fourth parts of&nbsp;the franchise about the Ghostface killer, Campbell had no&nbsp;noticeable movie roles until 2016. Now, she has returned to&nbsp;TV screens and has a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;the House of&nbsp;Cards TV&nbsp;series.</p><p>What actor didn’t deserve to&nbsp;be&nbsp;left out of&nbsp;big movie projects?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZurcKtpqurXay1sL%2FEZpqaqpWav7R51p6pnmWiqravscNmmbJln6Oybr7OpZxmb2lrgnSFjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
