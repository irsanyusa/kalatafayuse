He regrets the incident,” it added. The statement did not reference the kiss.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The video was taken in the Indian town of Dharamsala in February, at the temple where the Dalai Lama lives. In it, you can see the young boy asking for a hug. The Dalai Lama points to his cheek, saying “first here” after which the Dalai Lama points to his own lips and asks for another kiss. The 87-year-old priest then says “and suck my tongue” in the clip, putting his forehead closer to the young boy’s.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The clip was immediately criticized and viewed by millions of people online who were shocked by the Dalai Lama’s actions, <a href=# rel=noopener>calling</a> it “sick” and “pedophilic.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This is NOT playful banter & so inappropriate to use ‘affectionately plants kiss’ alongside ‘suck my tongue’. Hugs are fine[,] not this,” tweeted Dr. Shola Mos Shogbamimu, a British women’s rights activist . “Don’t normalize molestation of kids – don’t care how revered the Dalai Lama is I’m not OK with a child sucking a grown man/woman/anyone’s tongue.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sticking out your tongue is seen as a “sign of respect or agreement” and is a traditional Tibetan greeting, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to NPR</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dalai Lamas are believed to be “manifestations of Avalokiteshvara or Chenrezig, the Bodhisattva of Compassion and the patron saint of Tibet,” according to the current Dalai Lama’s <a href=# rel=noopener>online biography</a>. He <a href=# rel=noopener>won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989</a> for his nonviolent action against China’s occupation of Tibet. Tibetan Buddhists believe him to be a figure of peace that is a reincarnation of the 13 previous Dalai Lamas, all with a mission to help humanity.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Dalai Lama also has complicated ties to the self-help cult NXIVM, which has a history of sexual abuse. Leader Keith Raniere <a href=# rel=noopener>was sentenced to prison</a> after an investigation found that multiple women, including one teenage girl, was coerced into having sex with Raniere. The girls also had Raniere’s initials branded on their pelvises.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a nine-part documentary series on NXIVM, it was revealed that the Dalai Lama was invited to speak on compassionate ethics at a conference that was attended by NXIVM members in 2009, a decade before Raniere was convicted. The Dalai Lama received criticism prior to his scheduled appearance, causing him to cancel his visit, <a href=# rel=noopener>though he later attended</a> the conference.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamdlfnKBjp2YpZmZYrmiucBmoqKro5rAbq7OsmSaqJ%2BhvKi12Z6qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
