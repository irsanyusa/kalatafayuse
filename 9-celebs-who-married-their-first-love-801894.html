They have known each other for more than 40&nbsp;years, and they have 4&nbsp;children together. When asked about their secret to&nbsp;keeping their bond strong for so&nbsp;many years, Bon Jovi said that it’s their <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a> for each other. “And we&nbsp;really like each other. We&nbsp;want to&nbsp;hang out,” he&nbsp;<a href=#>added</a>.</p><p><h2>2. Snoop Dogg and Shante Broadus</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5cd/217/6b0ec25beea90e5a3a25d7c501.jpg><p>The award-winning rapper met his wife Shante when they were high school students. They got <a href=#>married</a> in&nbsp;1997, and although the couple filed for divorce in&nbsp;2004, they are still together and have 3&nbsp;children. They renewed their wedding vows in&nbsp;2008, and have been inseparable ever since.</p><p><h2>3. Bono and Ali Hewson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/655/4a3/5c580d5c98ad86fc48d68abf8c.jpg><p>The U2&nbsp;singer and his wife Ali Hewson have been <a href=#>married</a> for over 40&nbsp;years and have 4&nbsp;children. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview that happened to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;their anniversary, Bono said they <a href=#>met</a> in&nbsp;high school: “We&nbsp;were teenagers, went to&nbsp;the same high school. And just so&nbsp;happens that one afternoon&nbsp;I walked her to&nbsp;her bus.”</p><p><h2>4. Elizabeth Banks and Max Handelman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4f5/000/3f82b9506d8ca493d0ba244277.jpg><p>When the actress met her husband Max Handelman on&nbsp;her <a href=#>first day</a> of&nbsp;college, she didn’t think they’d get married because she was too young. “I&nbsp;didn’t meet my&nbsp;husband and think, I’ve met the man I’m going to&nbsp;marry,” she <a href=#>said</a>. “Really, what happened was I’ve never met anyone that&nbsp;I liked more,” she continued. “We&nbsp;work together every day, and we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;respect for each other on&nbsp;every level.”</p><p><h2>5. Heather Morris and Taylor Hubbell</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f4f/64d/de60bb5689bc2688f59bb8c41c.jpg><p>The Glee star and her husband Taylor Hubbell attended the same high school, but their relationship started years later when Hubbell got in&nbsp;touch with her via Myspace. The actress immediately felt they were meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;together, saying, “I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;marry him so&nbsp;bad. That’s what&nbsp;I really care about. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;marry Taylor and have kids with him,” she <a href=#>said</a>. The couple has been married since 2015 and they have 2&nbsp;children together.</p><p><h2>6. Samuel L. Jackson and LaTanya Richardson Jackson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/617/7a8/b01b735511a7ce1b9789e00db3.jpg><p>The award-winning actor and his wife LaTanya Richardson met when they were both <a href=#>college</a> students. The couple got married in&nbsp;1980 and managed to&nbsp;make their marriage work despite their busy careers. “We&nbsp;actually thought we&nbsp;were going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the black Liz Taylor and Richard Burton, but we&nbsp;were going to&nbsp;stay together!” the actor <a href=#>said</a>. “She’s had a&nbsp;good career. I’ve had a&nbsp;good career. So&nbsp;it’s worked.”</p><p><h2>7. Jeff Daniels and Kathleen Rosemary Treado</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c8d/e15/72594f54c5b1fc157ed149c8b3.jpg><p>The Dumb and Dumber actor married his high school sweetheart Kathleen in&nbsp;1979. Unlike many Hollywood stars, Daniels chose to&nbsp;raise his 3&nbsp;children in&nbsp;his hometown of&nbsp;Chelsea, Michigan. “I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;bring up&nbsp;my&nbsp;children in&nbsp;Hollywood or&nbsp;New York&nbsp;— it&nbsp;was just too important to&nbsp;get wrong. My&nbsp;career came second to&nbsp;that,” he&nbsp;<a href=#>said</a>.</p><p><h2>8. LL&nbsp;Cool J&nbsp;and Simone Smith</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/313/21f/809a525d5ebc9809eaf6b92371.jpg><p>The award-winning rapper and his wife, Simone Johnson, have been <a href=#>married</a> since 1995 and have 4&nbsp;children together. The singer says the <a href=#>secret</a> to&nbsp;their long-lasting marriage is&nbsp;being open with each other: “I’m not looking to&nbsp;win arguments, this isn’t debate class. We&nbsp;each express ourselves and then either fix the issue or&nbsp;move&nbsp;on.”</p><p><h2>9. Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Brad Hall</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d30/3a8/e566715c40a8f96d800fe233c9.jpg><p>The actress and comedian married her college sweetheart Brad Hall in&nbsp;1987. She knew almost right away that he&nbsp;was “the one.” “There were a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;moments, some of&nbsp;which&nbsp;I will not share, but&nbsp;I would say that&nbsp;I knew almost immediately. It’s really the truth,” the star <a href=#>revealed</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview.</p><p>Whose love story impressed you the most?
