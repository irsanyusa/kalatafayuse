She clarified that despite rumours, they are not in a romantic relationship.</p><p>"I'm significantly older, so I have more experience in life. So I know a bit more about the direction I want to go in. Also, this is my field of work. His own field of work would probably dabble into this one and cross others. But I'm fine. He's cool and walking gracefully in his own lane. We are not dating, and that's how it is," Venita affirmed.</p><p>The pair met back in 2022 during the seventh season of Big Brother Naija, and according to Adekunle, he took a liking to her within the first week in the house. They then reconnected during the All Stars season of the show in 2023 and bonded in the house again, with their romance in full view for the audience.</p><p>During the show, Venita was vocal about her affections towards him. However, the two have now gone their separate ways.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGaanJWgwq%2B4xGaYp5xdnnqivsRmrpqkm567qHnOrqlmq5WlrrOt055kqZmkncBursGnmKKikWLAta3RZq2eppmprnCuk6ypnGuX</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
