Some amazing albums have been released in the past few months all from the comfort of the musician’s homes. Today was no different with rapper Future and The Jonas Brother’s releasing some iconic tracks.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CAHKd0Ng7_q/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Future’s Album Was Certified Gold Within 30 Minutes Of Release</h2><p>Future’s eighth studio album “High Off Life” just released and fans are already eating it up. The 21 song album is certainly a lot to digest but each song makes a bold statement. This album features his best charting hit ever, “Life Is Good” featuring rap superstar Drake. The album also features <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# class=broken_link>Travis Scott</a>, Lil Uzi Vert, Meek Mill, Young Thug, NBA YoungBoy and plenty of other established rappers. He has achieved success immediately after the release as the album was quickly certified gold and it will surely continue to climb up the charts. Future fans took to social media to show their appreciation for his artistry and unique style.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Went gold in 30min.

We ain’t care bout no g*ddamn messy baby mamas….leave that unproblematic black king alone….and the album is straight.” This is in reference to the fact that the rapper recently had some baby mama drama, with more women claiming he has fathered their children. But this has not stopped him from putting out a record-shattering album.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>No Future slander will be tolerated.

Thought it was Future’s best album in a while” said another loyal fan. It seems like people really enjoyed his new music and appreciated all of the great features on the album.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Rapper Went On A Twitter Rant About Lori Harvey Before The Album Release</h3><p>Some people were a bit confused when he put out a few tweets throwing subliminal messages at girlfriend Lori Harvey. He tweeted “Ain mad at u for smashing/Fxxxxxx the homie u gotta get it how u live…smh.” It is unclear if he and Harvey are still together. But, he seems to be pointing fingers at her for sleeping with one of his friends. Future put out another tweet saying “I feel disrespected.” The pair are said to have hit a rough patch before the coronavirus pandemic began and are quarantining separately. Is there trouble in paradise? Some reports are swirling that Harvey is dating an entertainment executive. He did, however, give a shoutout to Harvey in one of the songs on the new album. “Give me glory/give me Lori,” he raps in the song “Accepting my Flaws.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ain mad at u for smashing/Fxxxxxx the homie u gotta get it how u live…smh</p>— FUTURE/FREEBANDZ (@1future) <a href=#>May 14, 2020</a></figure><p>The pair began dating back in October 2019. They would casually drop flirtatious comments on each other’s Instagram posts. It is interesting to note that Harvey did post that she was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>listening to the new album</a> in a few Instagram stories this morning. She posted screenshots of some of the song names with the comment “proud of you” with a flame emoji. So regardless if the couple is still together, she still supports his music.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Jonas Brothers Fans Raved About Their Two Newly Released Songs</h3><p>The Jonas Brothers have been on a roll lately. They just released “X” featuring Colombian singer&nbsp;<a href=#>Karol G</a>&nbsp;and “Five More Minutes.” The song “X” is a super flirty song that you will literally want to get up and dance to. The edition of Karol G spices the song up and gives it a new Latin flare. It is something entirely new for the band and fans really seem to love it. “Five More Minutes” is definitely a softer song. They are both very different but it just goes to show you that this group can do anything and always have fans rallying behind them with support.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RAPPER FUTURE SAYS ONLY 2 OF HIS 6 BABY MAMAS ARE HIS “REAL ONES” ON MOTHER’S DAY</a></strong></p><p>One fan touched on the two very different songs. “Only the Jonas Brothers can release two completely different songs that somehow fit soooo well together.. going out with the girls on Saturday night to a beach club with ‘X’ and waking up on Sunday morning with ‘Five More Minutes’.. kings..”&nbsp;she said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>only the Jonas Brothers can release two completely different songs that somehow fit soooo well together.. going out with the girls on Saturday night to beach club with X and waking up on Sunday morning with Five More Minutes.. kings.. <a href=#>@jonasbrothers</a> <a href=#>#JONASBROTHERSXV</a></p>— eva 🧋 (@nickjonxs) <a href=#>May 15, 2020</a></figure><p>“Wow didn’t know x by <a href=#>@jonasbrothers</a> & <a href=#>@karolg</a> was all my life needed” said another fan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/steph_royce11/status/1261311838911774720</p></figure><p>The Jonas Brothers have really made their comeback worthwhile. “We are in May and so far we have gotten what a man gotta do, a grammy performance/ nomination, a tour documentary, zoom calls with fans and now two new songs? the <a href=#>@jonasbrothers</a> are CEOs of bringing back happiness,” said a Twitter user.
