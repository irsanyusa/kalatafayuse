With epic renditions of&nbsp;“Chiseled in Stone” and&nbsp;“The Church on Cumberland Road,” Red was able to outshine the rockers, jazz crooners, and the blues singers on Season 13. The aspiring singer went from a two chair turn around to making it all the way to the finals. Red was 40 years old when he competed on the hit competition show. With his final shot at stardom, the singer did not pull any punches.</strong></p><p>Red is from Rogersville, Alabama, and lived and breathed country music. The singer grew up in the church and watched his father be a leader as a preacher. Red was introduced to bluegrass and gospel music at a young age and began singing after he was constantly exposed to great music. The singer had big dreams and moved to Nashville when he was 22 years old. While in the City of Music, Red ended up making a living as a demo singer and songwriter. 15 years had passed and the singer was no closer to breaking into the industry as a country solo artist.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Red Marlow Takes a Step Back</h2><p>Not seeing a way into the industry, Red took a step back from music in order to support his family. The aspiring singer launched his own construction company. Mr. Fix All was formed and allowed Red to live out his second passion, but music was still calling his name.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Red Continues His Music Journey</h2><p>Being fortunate enough to continue his demo singing and songwriting career, Red still dreamed of dominating country music. Before gracing The Voice stage, Red released three EPs. When The Sun Shines Too, Fire It Up, and Red Marlow all debuted in 2014. Red highlighted his songwriting as well as powerful vocal abilities. The projects did not thrust Red into the elite club of country music, but he started gaining a loyal fan base.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>His Time on ‘The Voice’</h2><p>The country crooner walked onto The Voice stage knowing this was his final shot at breaking into the music industry like he wanted to. Yes, Red made a living doing music but he wanted to be in the spotlight. The singer’s rendition of John Anderson’s “Swingin’ was enough to get a two chair turn around from judges Miley Cyrus and Blake Shelton. Although Cyrus promised Red that he would not get lost by being on her team, the singer still joined Team Blake. On The Voice there were times where Red was safe and times where he would have to sing for his life in order to win an instant save.</p><p>When the finale rolled around, Red performed Garth Brooks’&nbsp;“Make You Feel My Love,” with Shelton and his original song “I Pray.” Even with his loyal RedHead Fanbase, The singer had the least amount of votes and ended up in Fourth place.</p><p>Red Marlow’s The Voice dreams came true as he competed on Season 13. The 40 year old singer experienced the cheers, the lights and the praise while viewers were in awe of his talent. After being on the show, Red released his Country as Cornbread album. The singer sticks to the formula of what is expected on a country album, including a song about small towns,<a href=#> religion</a>, and of course drinking songs.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-23-at-9.25.26-AM-1.png alt="Howie Mandel Hits Golden Buzzer For 14 Year Old Singer During ‘CGT’ Premiere" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570Z6bZqWRp7mww4ytpqijXZZ6pLTAp5qeZZ%2BjerW0xGatqKGTmnq4tMSrnGaho2K1pnnNqK5o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
