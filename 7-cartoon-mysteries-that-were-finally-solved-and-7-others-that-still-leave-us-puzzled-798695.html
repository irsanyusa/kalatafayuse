You have probably questioned some of&nbsp;them more than once. For instance, what is&nbsp;there at&nbsp;ground level in&nbsp;The Jetsons, or&nbsp;why does Garfield hate Mondays? Some of&nbsp;the most frequently asked questions have been answered by&nbsp;the creators of&nbsp;the series or&nbsp;by&nbsp;people who took part in&nbsp;its production. On&nbsp;the other hand, others have remained pure speculation that makes sense but that no&nbsp;one has been able to&nbsp;confirm so&nbsp;far. And of&nbsp;course, some others are just unresolved, pure and simple.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>wants to&nbsp;share this list of&nbsp;solved and unsolved cartoon mysteries that have generated lots of&nbsp;buzz online. From theories to&nbsp;rumors and heated discussions, cartoon fans are very serious about these and we&nbsp;thought that maybe someone in&nbsp;our audience could help solve them.</p><p><h2>Unsolved Mysteries</h2></p><p><h2>1. Why do&nbsp;the Flintstones celebrate Christmas?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d3/454/8366515a98ab2c44cea34290ad.jpg><p>The Flintstones is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the cartoons that many generations have seen and that, interestingly enough, seems to&nbsp;not have aged at&nbsp;all. The story of&nbsp;the Flintstones and the Rubbles takes place in&nbsp;the <a href=#>Stone Age</a>, which began approximately 2,800,000 years ago and lasted until about 3,000&nbsp;BCE. In&nbsp;the West, <a href=#>Christmas</a> was not popularly celebrated, at&nbsp;least in&nbsp;artwork, until the middle of&nbsp;the 4th century. This has also caused a&nbsp;popular fan theory that the show doesn’t take place in&nbsp;the past, but in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>far-off future</a> where humans have transitioned back into a&nbsp;caveman-inspired lifestyle, albeit one with a&nbsp;1960s aesthetic.</p><p><h2>2. Where do&nbsp;Saint Seiya: Knights of&nbsp;the Zodiac’s clothes disappear to&nbsp;when they put on&nbsp;their armor?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f28/277/ade031549aa1efb7e49415f7a6.jpg><p>When the <a href=#>Saint Seiya: Knights of&nbsp;the Zodiac</a> characters transform themselves, before putting on&nbsp;their armor, they always wear normal clothes and then suddenly they appear with their stretchy armor/suit. So&nbsp;where do&nbsp;their clothes&nbsp;go? Why do&nbsp;their casual clothes sometimes reappear when they take off their armor, but at&nbsp;other times they don’t?</p><p><h2>3. What is&nbsp;the secret recipe for the Krabby Patty?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c0a/b01/4f431257968531487871ceba86.png><p>Bikini Bottom’s <a href=#>most popular restaurant</a> also happens to&nbsp;serve its most famous dish: the Krabby Patty. Many competitors have tried to&nbsp;imitate its success, but the <a href=#>Krabby Patty</a>’s formula is&nbsp;a&nbsp;complete mystery to&nbsp;everyone. Or&nbsp;well, almost everyone. In&nbsp;fact, Mr. Krab, founder and owner of&nbsp;the Krabby Patty, zealously protects the secret recipe, which his fierce rival Plankton has repeatedly tried to&nbsp;steal. Fans have long <a href=#>speculated</a> about what the secret ingredient&nbsp;is, and some have come to&nbsp;the conclusion that it’s crab meat, which kind of&nbsp;makes many people very uncomfortable. Series’ creator, Stephen Hillenburg, <a href=#>declared</a> a&nbsp;while ago that there is&nbsp;absolutely no&nbsp;meat in&nbsp;the dish. So&nbsp;even if&nbsp;the mystery is&nbsp;not entirely solved, at&nbsp;least we&nbsp;can be&nbsp;sure that this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;meal where no&nbsp;animal has suffered (specifically there’s no&nbsp;crabmeat from Mr. Krab).</p><p><h2>4. Why can Goofy talk and Pluto can’t?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/96c/ba6/03f8305c92948ebc5d6b5fb3ed.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the questions that people ask themselves often while watching Mickey and his friends is&nbsp;how come Goofy wears clothes and can talk and Pluto can’t. I&nbsp;mean, they’re both supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;dogs, right? Some people even believed, at&nbsp;first, that the reason was that Goofy was not really a&nbsp;dog, but was a&nbsp;cow instead. The rumor spread so&nbsp;much and so&nbsp;fast online that it&nbsp;reached the ears of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Disney data-link=tag>Disney</a> producers. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;put an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;the rumor, they denied this theory and confirmed that Goofy is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;dog via the <a href=#>official Twitter account</a> of&nbsp;the amusement park. But no&nbsp;matter how sure we&nbsp;are now that Goofy is&nbsp;a&nbsp;dog, there has not been a&nbsp;clear explanation as&nbsp;to&nbsp;why Pluto can’t talk.</p><p><h2>5. How can a&nbsp;fire be&nbsp;lit under the sea in&nbsp;SpongeBob Squarepants?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1bb/09d/5351f254759e55ccb4261788f2.jpg><p>We&nbsp;know, cartoons are nothing more than just... well, cartoons, but still, how does it&nbsp;make sense to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;whole world at&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the sea where you can light a&nbsp;fire? On&nbsp;many <a href=#>occasions</a>, SpongeBob has not only built fires, but he&nbsp;has also cooked, and there have even been wildfires in&nbsp;Bikini Bottom. This leads to&nbsp;another question: how can there be&nbsp;electricity there too?</p><p><h2>6. Gravity Falls’ hidden message from Bill Cipher</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d6e/11a/c4690e56a7be8e24e9036577e9.png><p>The ultimate villain of&nbsp;the series, and the most dangerous of&nbsp;all in&nbsp;<a href=#>Gravity Falls</a>, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;demon that can enter a&nbsp;person’s mind and control&nbsp;it. And even though he&nbsp;is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;defeated in&nbsp;the twentieth episode of&nbsp;the second season, before his death he&nbsp;says: “A-X-O-L-O-T-L! My&nbsp;time has come to&nbsp;burn! I&nbsp;invoke the ancient power that&nbsp;I may return!” Fans have long speculated about this strange message, which in&nbsp;fact, has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;played backward to&nbsp;be&nbsp;understood. Some of&nbsp;them believe that Bill Cipher might not have been defeated and could come back at&nbsp;some point if&nbsp;the series had a&nbsp;third season.</p><p><h2>7. How can CatDog coexist?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/014/a78/55bb5a5d298c7e866734b7bc3b.jpg><p>This Nickelodeon <a href=#>series</a> featured a&nbsp;Siamese cat and dog, which okay, that was strange enough in&nbsp;itself. But then, somehow, despite sharing the same body, the 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them were totally different. This is&nbsp;not only because they were 2&nbsp;completely different species, but also because they just had different personalities. What was never clear was how they could satisfy all (or&nbsp;any) of&nbsp;their needs...</p><p><h2>Mysteries that have been solved</h2></p><p><h2>1. Is&nbsp;Tarzan really Anna and Elsa’s younger brother?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/780/691/0dba2e569fb14034016fbdbe41.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Frozen, the king and queen of&nbsp;Arendelle, Anna and Elsa’s parents, get into an&nbsp;accident while crossing the ocean. Their ship sinks and they both lose their lives. However, the <a href=#>theory</a> by&nbsp;which all Disney films are connected encouraged fans to&nbsp;believe that Anna and Elsa’s parents could have survived the accident. According to&nbsp;them, they used a&nbsp;lifeboat and got lost. Then, the queen gave birth to&nbsp;another baby, who we&nbsp;would later meet as&nbsp;Tarzan. It&nbsp;all seemed very logical given the facts, but on&nbsp;Tarzan’s twentieth anniversary, Chris Buck, the film’s co-director, <a href=#>denied</a> the rumor. He&nbsp;apologized for having spread the word on&nbsp;public television and said that this theory was only based on&nbsp;his own personal opinion.</p><p><h2>2. Why are all Disney princesses motherless?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de5/20a/f0383958609097ad191bcf3f2c.jpg><p>Besides stories featuring Prince Charming prototypes and talking animals wandering here and there in&nbsp;the forest, Disney princesses have something else in&nbsp;common: many of&nbsp;them are motherless. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;recurring topic when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;Disney’s characters, that Snow White, Cinderella, Bella, Jasmine, and Ariel share. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a>, Disney producer Don Hahn said that this was most likely due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;tragic accident that Walt Disney actually experienced. Back in&nbsp;the day, he&nbsp;bought a&nbsp;house for both of&nbsp;his parents to&nbsp;live&nbsp;in. He&nbsp;had it&nbsp;renovated from top to&nbsp;bottom, including of&nbsp;course the kitchen oven. However, there was a&nbsp;gas leak that claimed his mother’s life (and caused his father to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hospitalized). This could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sad but true explanation. Still, we&nbsp;should remember that most of&nbsp;Disney’s films are inspired by&nbsp;traditional fairytales&nbsp;— which already existed in&nbsp;their current form long before they were turned into animated films. And it’s often a&nbsp;plot point for them not to&nbsp;have mothers; after all, Cinderella and Snow White have to&nbsp;lose their mothers since they both have to&nbsp;contend with a&nbsp;wicked stepmother.</p><p><h2>3. Why does Garfield hate Mondays?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/91c/d00/82803955c08314259f1fb2ef7b.jpg><p>Garfield, a&nbsp;cat as&nbsp;idle as&nbsp;he&nbsp;is&nbsp;greedy, does nothing but watch&nbsp;TV and sleep on&nbsp;the couch (when he’s not eating, of&nbsp;course). However, his love for lasagna is&nbsp;equally proportional to&nbsp;his hatred for Mondays. But why did he&nbsp;hate them so&nbsp;much, when every day was more or&nbsp;less the same for him? Creator Jim Davis <a href=#>explained</a>: “Garfield does not have a&nbsp;job, Garfield does not go&nbsp;to&nbsp;school and every day is&nbsp;the same. Nevertheless, every Monday is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;reminder that his life is&nbsp;the same old, same old cycling again and for some reason, even though his life is&nbsp;pretty much the same every day, on&nbsp;Mondays specifically, awful things tend to&nbsp;happen to&nbsp;him physically.”</p><p><h2>4. What dog breed is&nbsp;Scooby-Doo?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b72/22e/605ae552269b0aa0112d194983.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;television’s most famous and beloved dogs turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;Great Dane. However, there was always a&nbsp;question about whether this was true, as&nbsp;there were some physical traits in&nbsp;the dog’s appearance that did not entirely match a&nbsp;typical specimen of&nbsp;this breed. Iwao Takamoto, the creator of&nbsp;the cartoon, explained that when he&nbsp;sketched the <a href=#>character</a>, he&nbsp;talked to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Great Dane dog breeder, who gave him the characteristics of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pedigree dog. But Takamoto wanted Scooby to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the complete opposite of&nbsp;a&nbsp;typical Great Dane, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;draw a&nbsp;character with a&nbsp;curved back, bowed legs, a&nbsp;small chin, and a&nbsp;really distinctive color.</p><p><h2>5. Why was Mr. Krabs’ daughter a&nbsp;whale?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e3b/8bc/859cc853fb93035420ee37f000.jpg><p>The fact that Pearl and her father, Mr. Krabs, are 2&nbsp;different species has not directly been discussed in&nbsp;any episode of&nbsp;SpongeBob SquarePants. But actually, the members of&nbsp;the production team made it&nbsp;<a href=#>clear</a> that Mr. Krabs was married to&nbsp;a&nbsp;whale that gave birth to&nbsp;Pearl. Although Stephen Hillenburg, the creator of&nbsp;the series, received many letters asking him to&nbsp;tell the story of&nbsp;how a&nbsp;whale turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;crab’s daughter, he&nbsp;was always reluctant to&nbsp;give away the Krabs’ secret.</p><p><h2>6. Where are Arnold’s parents?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/495/c52/9bfeeb54ac8a4bda052c5d329c.jpg><p>Before the <a href=#>movie</a> Hey, Arnold! The Jungle Movie was released, what we&nbsp;knew about Arnold’s parents wasn’t much. In&nbsp;the series, it’s basically said that their names were Miles and Stella, and that they disappeared while on&nbsp;a&nbsp;humanitarian mission in&nbsp;Central America, where they had gone to&nbsp;cure the natives of&nbsp;a&nbsp;strange “sleeping sickness.” It&nbsp;was only after the movie was released that we&nbsp;learned that Arnold’s parents were, in&nbsp;fact, not entirely lost. It&nbsp;turns out they were also under the influence of&nbsp;the mysterious sleeping sickness, and in&nbsp;the end, he&nbsp;was finally able to&nbsp;reunite with them and he&nbsp;even managed to&nbsp;bring them back home.</p><p><h2>7. What is&nbsp;there at&nbsp;ground level in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;The Jetsons?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa7/9a0/dfcc9a523b93d1dc065282fb18.jpg><p>In&nbsp;The Jetsons, the people of&nbsp;the year 2062 already live in&nbsp;high buildings, use flying cars, and spend almost their entire lives many meters above sea level. But what is&nbsp;happening at&nbsp;ground level during that whole time? In&nbsp;some <a href=#>episodes</a> you can see what happens “down there.” Take, for instance, the one where a&nbsp;homeless man is&nbsp;seen walking. There’s also that time when a&nbsp;bird chooses to&nbsp;walk on&nbsp;the asphalt, because there’s too much traffic in&nbsp;the air.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have any theories about the unsolved mysteries of&nbsp;these cartoons? What other mysteries do&nbsp;you think can be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;cartoons, that could have an&nbsp;explanation?
