We leave all this behind in bed.</p><p>Bedding that has not been changed for too long is an ideal environment for the development of bacteria and fungi that are dangerous to health. Microbiologists recommend changing bedding at least every week. Sleeping in dirty bedding for too long may result in skin diseases, allergies or asthma.</p><p>Pillowcases and sheets should be changed to clean ones every seven days, although you can change them more often. Most people do this much less often. This may cause frequent throat or skin problems.</p><p>Changing your bedding every week may seem like a hassle, but microbiologists say it's absolutely necessary.</p><p>Changing bedding frequently to clean ones will have a positive impact on our health and well-being, and will also benefit our beauty. Not everyone is aware, but rarely washed pillowcases can cause pimples on the face or worsen acne . If you have any skin problems, whether oily, dry or sensitive, pay special attention to changing your bed linen regularly. After just a few weeks you will notice a significant difference.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Leaving bed linen for a long time also causes your hair to become greasy. What's the point of washing them regularly if they stay in contact with a dirty pillowcase for long hours at night? It is worth keeping this in mind and remembering to wash the bedding frequently.</p><p>Plus, sleeping in clean sheets is simply more pleasant. Why take away this luxury?</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>How should you wash bed linen?</h2></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-ce7ffc77-91ae-4ea3-a899-76e415cd2367 data-caption="Bedding needs to be changed often, at least every week [bestlife]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/zv-ktkpTURBXy9mMjFmODE1MmYzZTUwY2ViMjcyOTFhOGI2OTY1ODNmNC5qcGeSlQMAAM0CgM0BaJUCzQKAzQFowsM></span><p>To remove all impurities, as well as bacteria and fungi, bedding should be washed at high temperature. It is recommended that it be at least 60 degrees Celsius. The lower one is not able to completely eliminate dangerous microorganisms.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In addition to weekly washing, bedding should also be aired. Ideally, you should do this every day. Under no circumstances should you make your bed immediately after getting up. It is worth shaking the bedding at least a few times and waiting for at least 10 minutes.</p><p>All these rules seem troublesome, but following them can protect against many unpleasant ailments. Experts make it clear: bedding needs to be changed often, at least every week. Failure to do so may have a negative impact on our health.</p><p>In addition to washing the bedding, it is also worth remembering to keep the mattress clean. This is much more difficult. You can't just throw it into the washing machine. So what should we do? Sprinkle the mattress with baking soda . This way we will refresh it and remove all bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microorganisms that may have nested there. Soda will cope with them perfectly.</p><p>How often do you change your bed linen?</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This article was originally published on <a href=# id=bc0d7d23-db41-482d-8d70-d9974859f743 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>Onet Woman</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZK%2BmrdStsGaglZa5tbSOoaawZZ%2Bbwaa6jKyfqK2cmXq6u9RmmqGZnpyybsXOrqlmmpWZerS0xJ6rrGeerrdygc2t</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
