Mike Candys</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/761/168/34399b5493a592912bdfcd27e9.jpg><p>Just like many famous musicians, DJ&nbsp;Mike Candys is&nbsp;famous for his mask. With this giant yellow helmet, he&nbsp;looks like a&nbsp;living emoji. Mike Candys’ real name is&nbsp;<strong>Michael Kull</strong>. The music producer and&nbsp;DJ is&nbsp;37&nbsp;and he&nbsp;comes from Switzerland. He&nbsp;gained a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;popularity with his remixes and was even in&nbsp;the European top charts for a&nbsp;long time.</p><p>Mike doesn’t want to&nbsp;just create music, but an&nbsp;entire show. His emoji helmet helps him when performing and entertaining his audience. The first concepts of&nbsp;the stage mask were dragon heads, but Mike decided to&nbsp;simplify everything and came up&nbsp;with this smiling emoji.</p><p>More info <a href=#>here</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c2/b61/0eb21e56499b0aa1381b1b06eb.jpg><p><h2>7. Daft Punk</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce1/e02/c3042e5d2f8c990ea4feadf58b.jpg><p>This music duo was formed in&nbsp;the early 90s in&nbsp;France. Their real names are <strong>Guy-Manuel de&nbsp;Homem-Christo</strong> and <strong>Thomas Bangalter</strong>. It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;surprising, but these guys hadn’t always had their helmets&nbsp;on. At&nbsp;the very beginning of&nbsp;their career they performed and appeared on&nbsp;TV <a href=#>without any costumes</a>.</p><p><a href=#>The first masks</a> appeared in&nbsp;the late 90’s during their shows in&nbsp;France. Soon their stage image was developed and masks were substituted with futuristic helmets and classy suits. Nowadays it’s really hard to&nbsp;find their present photos without the “armor” since they come to&nbsp;any event very well-dressed and in&nbsp;full disguise. But in&nbsp;2014 photographers managed to&nbsp;<a href=#>catch them</a> on&nbsp;camera in&nbsp;the airport, after the musical couple came home from The Grammy Awards.</p><p>More info <a href=#>here</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f66/300/7e9fd152bd970bda51620216a0.jpg><p><h2>6. Slipknot</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c2d/1fb/5e4ef7561590383cb4a7c63ff9.jpg><p>Slipknot wear their masks to&nbsp;drive public attention away from themselves and onto their music. “It’s our way of&nbsp;becoming more intimate with the music,” comments the vocalist. The idea of&nbsp;covering their face was brought up&nbsp;by&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the group members who would often bring a&nbsp;mask to&nbsp;rehearsals. The concept was developed further and soon matching costumes were added to&nbsp;their stage image.</p><p>Slipknot managed to&nbsp;keep their faces hidden for many years. As&nbsp;the band’s popularity grew rapidly, band members identities were eventually revealed. Their names are: <strong><a href=#>Sid Wilson</a></strong> (keyboards), <a href=#><strong>Alessandro Venturella</strong> </a>(bass), <strong><a href=#>Jay Weinberg</a></strong> (drums), <strong><a href=#>Chris Fehn</a></strong> (percussion), <strong><a href=#>Jim Root</a></strong> (lead guitar), <strong><a href=#>Craig Jones</a></strong> (keyboards&nbsp;/ lead guitar), <strong><a href=#>Shawn Crahan</a></strong> (percussion&nbsp;/ backing vocals),<a href=#> <strong>Mick Thomson</strong></a> (rhythm guitar), and <strong><a href=#>Corey Taylor</a></strong> (vocals).</p><p>More info <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p><h2>5. deadmau5</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bac/79d/9e450e5eb8976d552cfaef35e9.jpg><p>Deadmau5, a&nbsp;famous&nbsp;DJ from Canada with his collection of&nbsp;mouse masks in&nbsp;different styles, colors and sizes, can’t be&nbsp;left unnoticed. His music nickname was inspired by&nbsp;the body of&nbsp;a&nbsp;frozen mouse that he&nbsp;found in&nbsp;a&nbsp;computer he’d constructed. He&nbsp;created a&nbsp;helmet to&nbsp;support the name, and it&nbsp;became an&nbsp;essential accessory in&nbsp;his image.</p><p>The persona behind this customized huge mask is&nbsp;<strong>Joel Zimmerman</strong>. The huge tattoos related to&nbsp;video games and anime leave no&nbsp;doubts. Moreover, this&nbsp;DJ doesn’t mind removing the mask in&nbsp;many of&nbsp;his music videos.</p><p>More info <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p><h2>4. Cazzette</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d8c/a2e/e091975fdca332b18435fcb687.jpg><p>This Swedish DJ&nbsp;duo brought the <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> for enormous helmets to&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole new level. Much more like their stage name, they wear giant cassettes on&nbsp;their heads with winding circles as&nbsp;the eyes. This smart self-presentation attracts even more fans and interest to&nbsp;these musicians.</p><p>Their names are <strong>Alexander Björklund</strong> and <strong>Sebastian Furrer</strong>. In&nbsp;2011 the DJs gave their first performance in&nbsp;Sweden. After reaching the top of&nbsp;the charts in&nbsp;their homeland they started to&nbsp;play worldwide, sharing their music with their fans on&nbsp;a&nbsp;global scale.</p><p>More info <a href=#>here</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c4c/52b/56d0c352f9869ba8ab32246312.jpg><p><h2>3. Marshmello</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/06f/1b0/4ed6ad53ada5c53f0b07f9d80a.jpg><p>If&nbsp;we&nbsp;even mention the words “overnight sensation” then it’s obviously about <strong>Marshmello</strong>. A&nbsp;few years back this talented guy, with a&nbsp;giant eye-catching marshmallow mask, launched onto the music scene gaining an&nbsp;incredible amount of&nbsp;fame very quickly. He&nbsp;has created a&nbsp;mystery about his real identity and this ignites the audience to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;know him even more.</p><p>There have been a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fake reveals by&nbsp;Marshmello himself: once he&nbsp;turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Will Ferrell, another time&nbsp;— Shawn Mendes. Yet <strong>Marshmello’s real identity is&nbsp;Christopher Comstock aka DJ&nbsp;Dotcom</strong>. Both have the same names, birth dates, tattoo management, and identical music styles.<br>Also, in&nbsp;2015 Skrillex had an&nbsp;interview with ’Yahoo!’ when his phone rang, and the voice said: “It’s Chris,” “Oh, Marshmello”&nbsp;— Skrillex responded.</p><p>More info <a href=#>here</a> and <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p><h2>2. Banksy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/67e/347/e723a553f4a426e1e60ffdea4b.jpg><p><strong>Banksy</strong> is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the world’s most controversial artists. His striking graffiti has turned the world of&nbsp;art upside-down. The problems he&nbsp;illustrates in&nbsp;his work draw a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;public attention and leave no&nbsp;one indifferent. However, after 20&nbsp;years on&nbsp;the graffiti scene, his identity still remains unknown.</p><p>After years of&nbsp;wrong guessing, most of&nbsp;his fans believe right now&nbsp;— <strong>Banksy is&nbsp;Robin Gunningham</strong>. A&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;<a href=#>him with some graffiti supplies</a> right beside his graffiti “Boy of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Lifebuoy” surfaced. All the doubts were completely dispelled a&nbsp;long time ago when Banksy revealed his “shredding prank.” During the general panic and excitement someone managed to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;the artist <a href=#>filming the shredding</a>.</p><p>More info <a href=#>here</a> and <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p><h2>1. Buckethead</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4f7/be3/e489775b159ed40713eceaa28b.jpg><p>Talented multi-musician <strong>Buckethead</strong> is&nbsp;probably the most mysterious public persona nowadays. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;known for performing on&nbsp;stage while wearing a&nbsp;white theater mask and a&nbsp;bucket on&nbsp;his head. Buckethead tells fans his official creepy story: he&nbsp;was raised by&nbsp;chickens and one day the chickens scratched his face off, but it&nbsp;didn’t really matter to&nbsp;him. That just meant he&nbsp;got to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;mask everyday like on&nbsp;Halloween. Now Buckethead travels the world giving huge performances and informing the public about the terrible things people do&nbsp;to&nbsp;his feathered-friends in&nbsp;fast-food restaurants around the world.</p><p>The real name of&nbsp;this “chicken-guy” is&nbsp;Brian Patrick Carroll. When asked about his mask by&nbsp;MTV News, Buckethead simply replied, “There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;mask.” T<strong>he Internet is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;fake photos and reveals of&nbsp;Buckethead’s real face, but since he&nbsp;is&nbsp;so&nbsp;secretive, no&nbsp;one has actually ever seen him without his mask.</strong></p><p>More info <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>Did we&nbsp;mention your favorite celebrity?
