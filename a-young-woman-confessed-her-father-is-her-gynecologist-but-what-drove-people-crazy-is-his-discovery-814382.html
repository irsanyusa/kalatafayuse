The relationship between fathers and daughters is something truly special. It is a connection that can last a lifetime.

It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;connection that can last a&nbsp;lifetime. To&nbsp;nurture this bond, a&nbsp;father needs to&nbsp;provide unconditional love, be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good role model, have good communication, and never hold back his child’s personal growth.</p><p>In&nbsp;this way, the father-daughter relationship is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one to&nbsp;envy. In&nbsp;addition, another way to&nbsp;foster bonding can be&nbsp;to&nbsp;recognize each other’s accomplishments, spend time together and encourage independence. In&nbsp;most cases, a&nbsp;strong bond is&nbsp;usually the most advisable; however, some people take it&nbsp;too far, and we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;tell you the story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;daughter who may have too much confidence in&nbsp;her father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/628/9ce/4ea28754108eda3a88488c0134.jpg><p>First of&nbsp;all, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;clarify that experts recommend attending a&nbsp;gynecological consultation at&nbsp;least once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>every three years</a> to&nbsp;verify that everything is&nbsp;in&nbsp;order or&nbsp;detect any problems early. However, finding a&nbsp;trusted gynecologist can be&nbsp;difficult.</p><p>But can you imagine going for a&nbsp;consultation with your dad as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gynecologist? Well, a&nbsp;young woman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a> on&nbsp;social media that her dad is&nbsp;her gynecologist, and this caused a&nbsp;great deal of&nbsp;controversy.</p><p>Many people have expressed disapproval and concern about the situation, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;uncomfortable and unprofessional. After all, sexual health is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important topic and should be&nbsp;treated with seriousness and respect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f8b/7be/6a0aff56eab427b29d547a844c.jpg><ul><li>The caption reads: “When your gynecologist —who is&nbsp;also your dad— gives you your annual checkup and discovers that your boyfriend was cheating on&nbsp;you...”</li></ul><p>It&nbsp;turns out that in&nbsp;a&nbsp;video she posted on&nbsp;TikTok, Isabel Salas (<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>@isabelsalasv</a>) showed how her dad noticed something strange during the examination.</p><p>In&nbsp;the video, you can see the office and the screen showing the results of&nbsp;the checkup. Afterward, the woman recorded her dad sitting at&nbsp;his desk while entering some data from the consultation into his database.</p><p>The video went <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>viral</a> within hours and TikTok users had mixed opinions. But what drew the most attention was the question of&nbsp;how the dad became aware of&nbsp;the infidelity of&nbsp;Isabel’s boyfriend.</p><p>It&nbsp;turns out that Isabel revealed that she had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recurrent infections</a> despite treatment. Then, her TikTok followers were completely baffled and wondered if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;appropriate for a&nbsp;father to&nbsp;examine his daughter in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way. Some even took the opportunity to&nbsp;make <a href=# title=jokes data-link=tag>jokes</a> about it&nbsp;with comments like “The real ’pap-nicolau’... hope you’re feeling well!”</p><p>Others, meanwhile, threw out <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>comments</a> like “I&nbsp;don’t think&nbsp;I would let my&nbsp;dad be&nbsp;my&nbsp;gynecologist.” or&nbsp;“Aren’t doctors, physicians, etc. not supposed to&nbsp;give consultations to&nbsp;their <a href=#>relatives</a>?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uxc6upaBlp6S6orqMnKannpWowKawjKGcq2WWlsGpsdFmoKxlmJq%2FbrPYp5ycp5yktKq%2F02aZrqxdrLWiwIydqaiulWK9prvPpZxmm6KWx7p5yKxkoaGjYrGqv8KorZ6qqWKFcoCScWlo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
