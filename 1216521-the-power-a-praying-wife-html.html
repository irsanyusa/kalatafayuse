Someone gets stable and calm happiness and others are always fighting for their marriage. If living together is falling apart, you can not get along with your husband, or he is in a difficult situation, resort to a comforting prayer.</p><p class=align-left>Calling to the higher forces, you will find the necessary answers, but not everyone is able to recognize them and distinguish between signs. Prayer is not an instant remedy that excludes all troubles and misfortunes, but it has tremendous power. There is a belief that women's prayer embodies the energy power in high concentration.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f0507c44c18ef423.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best bible verses about family that assure you peace</span></p></a><p class=align-left>By praying, you surrender yourself to the power of God, denying anger and pride. Only in this case the appeal will be perceived in the right way and be heard. Realize that true love can not stand selfishness, so prayer for the husband must be freed from any claims.</p><p class=align-left>Why pray for a husband? In society, it is common that a man carries the main part of responsibilities. Sometimes, it is not easy to cope with this, so the woman becomes support for her spouse. To pray for your spouse is to ask the blessings for your couple from Heaven. A woman who asks the supreme power of assistance for her spouse should pray properly:</p><ul><li>Reading canonical prayer is desirable, but it is not a requirement. You have the right to use your own words, pronounce them out loud, or pronounce them in thoughts. This prayer is distinguished by sincerity, not a thoroughly learned text.</li><li>Even if you are offended by your spouse, do not speak ill of him. An evil thought, even if it is not said out loud, has adverse energy, which has no place during prayer.</li><li>Frequent prayer is a guarantee that God will hear the request since the power of the faithful spouse is limitless.</li><li>When you pray, you need to be aware that you are not conspiring or plotting, but are turning to the Almighty. Be pious and modest, keep your temper in check and do not overreact, even if you are sick at heart.</li><li>During praying mention the name of the husband several times.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/deb631b5ebef21bc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to get over someone you love – best tips</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f0507c44c18ef423.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Bible verses about trusting God</p><p class=align-left>When a woman prays for her husband, the power of her praying acquires an unprecedented value if she has real feelings for him. Remember this and never ask a higher power to punish or penalize a spouse for his misdeeds. Most often, the wife applies to God in prayers, asking for health for her husband. You can pray for healing or good health for your husband to several saints.</p><p class=align-left>For a man, a successful career is a primary factor proving his viability as a professional and personality. It is no secret that many representatives of the stronger gender put their careers in the first place in the list of personal priorities, neglecting the family, wife and even children. If a woman shows understanding and supports her spouse in everything, it is a good practice to pray for her husband about work and health.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f26f6f7e6e49d81d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>These deep emotional Bob Marley quotes will shake your world!</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Remember that praying to the Lord for financial stability and career well-being for a loved one will pay off only if you are sincere in your words. Some wives might be jealous of their spouse for work and continuously reproach them because of carelessness to family caused by the job. It is impossible to experience such emotions and pray to God. To begin with, put offenses away and only then appeal to God with any request.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/deb631b5ebef21bc.jpeg><p class=align-left>Cheating is a heavy burden for a woman. It is difficult to imagine that a loved one betrays you, either morally or physically. It is hard to endure betrayal, and for some, it becomes such a hard blow that they cannot recover from it for a long time or even make a decision to divorce. So it is essential for a wife to pray for a strong marriage and loyalty.</p><p class=align-left>Family life brings both peace and frustration. Weigh them on the scale - if the positive ones outweigh, fight for your marriage with all available means. Prayer for the preservation of the family is the simplest, but no less effective method. Consider that marriage is a permanent job, and you need to work not only to correct the husband’s mistakes but also to fix your shortcomings.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/870543a20a53e27a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The power of praise as the human sanctification process</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Prayer for marriage to happen</p><h2>Prayer of wife for her husband</h2><p class=align-left>Here are some wife prayers, that might help you apply to God when you feel like your husband needs some more help from heavens.</p>Lord, I pray that You would bless my husband’s work.
