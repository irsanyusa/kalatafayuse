This tune was released two weeks ago, but Keys had been <a href=#>hinting at a music video</a> on her Instagram for quite some time. Now that it’s finally here, I can definitely say her <a href=#>“Queen” earrings</a> are totally justified.</strong></p><p id=h-the-time-has-finally-come-for-the-music-video-of-lala-by-alicia-keys-this-tune-was-released-two-weeks-ago-but-keys-had-been-hinting-at-a-music-video-on-her-instagram-for-quite-some-time>This music video began with Keys walking down a grand staircase. She looked like an absolute Goddess in a black dress with a silver rhinestone neckline that almost looked like a mock-neck cape. Her hair was slicked back in a high, long braid that accentuated the length of the dress perfectly.</p><p>Other than Keys, we saw Swae Lee in this video. He is wearing a blue suit coat with two chunky necklaces. The look showed off the tattoos on his abdomin throughout the video. Although the video mostly focused in the two main singers, there were tons of other people there.</p><p>Special guests of the video include Khalid, Lucky Daye, <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a>, D Smoke, Gunna, Mike WiLL Made-It, along with <a href=#>a few others</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>It was really cool that Keys and Swae were able to include some of the biggest names in the genre in this video. Even with this big names, it felt very natural to have all of those people there. They weren’t in your face about it at all. If I didn’t know they were in the video, I probably wouldn’t have picked them out of the crowd.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lala-visual-aspects-compliment-the-song-s-relaxing-nature>“LALA” Visual Aspects Compliment the Song’s Relaxing Nature</h2><p>This is a very relaxing song. This is the type of song that could cool me down after a particularly stressful day. I was happy to see that the music video didn’t make this jam feel any less relaxing. Don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of people seen within this video, but it’s never overwhelming.</p><p>The soothing nature behind this R&B song and silky camerawork gave the whole video a very natural feel. There are plenty of times we see people conversing, and most of them seem pretty genuine. Even though it was most likely staged, the video itself doesn’t seem it at all.</p><p>I think this overall feeling for the video compliments the song very well. None of this video feels out of place given the nature of the song. The overall experience of the song hasn’t changed at all. I originally described this song as easy to listen to, with the ability to sit back and relax. Even with this star-studded music video I feel that exact way.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-23-at-11.18.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Winner Dustin Tavella Heads to ‘The Ellen DeGeneres Show’ with a Mind-Blowing Trick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>alicia keys</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKWgnKGRYrimxdJmqrCZlWK5prGMrKyrqp%2Bqu6V506GcpquVocOmv4ywoK2gXZuurrvUrGSfqpmau6W%2FjKKlZqSRoa5uudSsoJxlpp6xpruO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
