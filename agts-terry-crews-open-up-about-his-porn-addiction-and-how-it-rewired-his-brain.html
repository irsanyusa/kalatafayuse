The TV star gave an informative broadcast from his home in Santa Clarita on the hidden dangers behind online pornography and how it affected him at such a young age.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Terry Crews’ Plea To The Quarantined People Watching Porn</h2><p>While people all over the world are quarantined, the rise in pornography has been <a href=#>widely reported</a>. One of the most popular porn sites PornHub is actually offering free preniums upgrades to the people in Italy (Wonder what the Pope thinks about that?). Although it is seen as a healthy outlet for plenty of adults, that is not the case for Terry Crews and he wants to share that with people. In this very detailed video below, the AGT host opens up about his addiction and the impact it had on his brain and his marriage.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>This is also not the first time Crews has opened up about his addiction that “rewired” his brain.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>RELATED: <a href=# class=broken_link><strong>HERE ARE THE SHOCKING TOP PORN SEARCHES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC</strong></a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Terry Crews’ Long Time Struggle With Pornography Addiction</h2><p>Ever since Terry Crews confessed to his wife about his addiction to pornography, he has spoken openly online&nbsp;about its dangers. The TV star even appeared on the Dr. Phil show to elaborate on his years of addiction to pornography and how it nearly ended his marriage. Now, as the masses&nbsp;are stuck&nbsp;inside due to the ongoing&nbsp;Coronavirus&nbsp;epidemic and more people are turning to pornography for a dopamine hit, Crews took to&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;Live to share his story.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“I notice that people are using porn as a way to get through this”, begins Crews. ‘What is porn? What is it about? It’s when you&nbsp;are basically&nbsp;using an image or images of other people, human beings and treating them like your personal objects”, he continued.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=#>‘AGT’ JUDGE HEIDI KLUM FINALLY REVEALS HER CORONAVIRUS RESULTS</a></strong></p><p>America’s Got Talent host then went into detail on the common confusion between sex and love. ‘What’s wild is that so many people now have confused sex with love. Love, however, has concern for the other person.” Crews made it clear he doesn’t agree with banning pornography all together but&nbsp;believes&nbsp;that “you need all the information” first.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Crews shares his first experiences with pornography at a young age</h3><p>“I&nbsp;was exposed&nbsp;at a very young age”, says Crews as he begins to detail his first experiences with pornography. He goes on to say, “I didn’t even know what sex was. I was totally blown away. The images take over your whole mind, it was&nbsp;rewiring&nbsp;my whole brain”.</p><p>Terry then explains that the pornographic magazines that he was&nbsp;mesmerized&nbsp;by as a child, were easier to regulate when it came to who read them. Now, with online pornography sites across the internet, requiring no age confirmation, it poses a threat to the young generation. “Porn is trying to get people under 18. Most people I know&nbsp;have been exposed&nbsp;at a very young age”. <a href=#>America’s Got Talent </a>host then compares the way pornography works to the drug dealers within his hometown of Flint, Michigan. He says that the drug dealers of his town would give out crack cocaine for free, knowing they will return once hooked. Crews says pornography websites act in a similar way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>TRENDING:</strong> <strong><a href=# class=broken_link>‘AMERICAN IDOL’ HOLLYWOOD WEEK: JUDGES RUSH OFF STAGE TO COMFORT CONTESTANT AFTER SHE HAS A SEIZURE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Catch America’s Got Talent Season 15 this summer on NBC.</strong></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Masked-Singer-T-Rex.jpg alt="The T-Rex on ‘The Masked Singer’ Is…" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrrGWkmr%2BzxYycqZ6vo2K8sbHNZqypZZGXvLbAjKGgrGWgpL%2BvecCdm6KbpJ68r3nAp5tmoJ%2BseqrAjKucsKGimrFutMisZJuqkZ67cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
