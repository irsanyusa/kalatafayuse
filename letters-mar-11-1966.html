If contemporary native humor lacks the comic, it is no less true that poetry has won for itself the name of “antipoetry”; the human portrait in painting and sculpture is a confused mass of cogs and angles; the latest creative hero, Truman Capote, in writing a novel, has disposed of fiction; finally, we have a rising school of theologians who advocate religion without God!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JOHN COURNOS</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">New York City</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the Year 2000</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: Your Essay “The Futurists” [Feb. 25] leaves me with just one happy thought: that I shall not be alive in the year 2000.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">(MRS.) RUTH CHASE Ferrisburg, Vt.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: What is predicted is a decadence similar to that which ended the glories of ancient Greece and Rome.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The most frightening prediction is the use of DNA to “control the shape of men to come.” This reminds me of the young bride whose husband had been transferred from Iowa to Boston. At a welcoming tea, a proper Bostonian lady remarked: “Here we regard breeding as everything.” The young bride retorted: “In Iowa we think breeding is fun, but we don’t think it’s everything.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">J.

How I wish I had saved a copy of the program he played in Canton, China in the summer of 1935. He had been engaged by my father, Edward Lockwood, to appear at the Chinese Y.M.C.A. and had telephoned from Hong Kong the evening before, reading off the selections in his thick Polish accent to a Cantonese printer. On the program, set without proofreading, Showpan was represented by several ayetoods and a couple of scaretzos. The hall was stuffed, the temperature stood at over 100° and Mr. Rubinstein, dressed in full concert regalia, played a two-hour program, a half hour of encores, and left the stage with his clothes soaked through. As a boy of 15, I was assigned to take Rubinstein on a ricksha tour of this teeming river port. I shall never forget his courtesy or his marvelous enthusiasm. He was a young 48 then, and by golly, he’s a young 79 now. Salut!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">RICHARD LOCKWOOD</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">East Lansing, Mich.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Commitments on Viet Nam</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: For ten months I have been in Viet Nam, where much of my work has been with refugee Vietnamese. They do not comprehend the philosophies of free government or totalitarianism, but they want protection from communist brutality, and many have asked us for it even after their homes have been destroyed by our forces in the inevitable turmoil of war. Professor Kennan [Feb. 18] argues that because of our commitments to the Vietnamese, “our relations with the Soviet Union have suffered . . .” For the sake of the free world and of the South Vietnamese in particular, I am relieved that Kennan has retired from the State Department.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JOHN G.

I think it is of men like Fulbright that Kennedy wrote Profiles in Courage—men who had guts and spirit in the face of opposition, however official it might be. America will rue the day when the Fulbrights of the Senate hold their tongues. I might not agree with all he says, but I admire and respect him for saying it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">AKBAR S.

The quote attributed to Wayne Wood was by Chad Price, an Emory junior who has lost his chance for Phi Beta Kappa and will probably not be accepted at Cornell Medical School because of his time-consuming efforts on behalf of Affirmation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">REMAR M.

Hitler thought this a good idea.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">PETER A-B GIBSON</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Butte, Mont.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hastening the Date</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: Thank you for covering the wedding of Meki Toalepai and Jo Ann Kovacs [Feb. 25]. It may help get antimiscegenation laws repealed. After premarital counseling, during which we considered the usual marriage problems and any extra ones this couple might have, I was convinced they have a right to happiness and as much chance of obtaining it as others. Though I would not go out of my way to encourage interracial or interfaith marriages, I feel we have neither a moral nor a constitutional right to forbid them.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">(THE REV.)

It is usual to get written permission from both parties. Neither ever sees the donor; to both, he is forever anonymous. AID can only remotely be construed as adultery; it is a medically accepted procedure to remedy some cases of infertility, and no more.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">WARREN BRUNDAGE SHEPARD, M.D.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Director, Obstetrics</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shadyside Hospital</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pittsburgh</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tomorrow’s Doctors</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: About trends in medical education [Feb. 25]: at Ohio State University College of Medicine, the student may study anatomy in a structured program or pursue this subject at his own pace. Forty per cent of students follow the free program. Taking the same exam at the end of the year, the two groups perform equally well.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">LLOYD R.

Such study does not imply softness. Taft boys freed to do their own work testify that their own standards are even more exacting. Nor does independent study mean the faculty has less to do. Lecturing three times a week to a class takes less time than guiding each student individually.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JOHN C.

The only thing he might be able to do is blow up a tire if the air compressor broke down.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">RAY RILEY</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">T/SGT, U.S.A.F.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Aberdeen, Md.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Breaking the Diet</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: As a missionary in Kerala, India for 17 years, I disagree that “the vast majority” of the catch of shrimp, lobster, mackerel and sardines is sold for export, and that Keralans “largely ignore the sweet potatoes, bananas, pineapples and coconuts that abound” in the state [Feb. 25]. Fish and shrimp are part of the regular diet of millions of people, and the other items mentioned are eaten daily. Unfortunately, the prices of such commodities have risen tremendously recently.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">H. E.

That ought to give him a lift.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROY H.

In 1900, the “Curved Dash” Oldsmobile was developed at the Olds Motor Works. It was some time later that the Oldsmobile became associated with G.M.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">METTA ANDERSON</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">East Lansing, Mich.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nectar of the Globs</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: I hurl myself into the breach in defense of Paul Ricard, inventor of the finest drink since sour mash [Feb. 25]. Your reporter, probably an undercover man for the W.C.T.U., has slandered the drinking man’s Thomas Edison in saying that ice added to Ricard’s pastis turns the licorice into a gooey glob. I modestly claim the record for annual consumption by an American of this delightful brew, and have yet to find a single glob in any of my well-iced drinks. Retract your calumny against this benefactor of mankind.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">C. O.

Two Ricards should be the maximum; I once tried three and felt that I was the most fascinating type, physically and intellectually, in the sixth arrondissement. Such illusions are not good for a man of my age.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">W. L.
