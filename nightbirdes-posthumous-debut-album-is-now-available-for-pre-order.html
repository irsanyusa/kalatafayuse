She stepped on the international stage as a woman fighting breast cancer with “two percent chance of survival.” Her fearless story and stirring vocals have inspired millions of audiences, making her a standout in the series.</p><p>However, Nightbirde <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">withdrew from the competition</a> weeks after her groundbreaking audition as her health had taken a “turn for the worse.” Subsequently, after a four-year battle with cancer, she died on February 19, 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nightbirde-s-family-to-drop-her-debut-album-on-first-death-anniversary>Nightbirde’s Family to Drop Her Debut Album on First Death Anniversary</h2><p>On Sunday, the foundation’s Instagram broke the news, introducing Nightbirde’s first album, It’s OK. This music collection contains 10 tracks, including nine full-length songs alongside 11 interludes with quotes spoken by the AGT contestant herself.</p><p>Apparently, It’s OK will mark Nightbirde’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first death anniversary</a>. Proceeds from the album sales will serve as funds for the foundation, one which she and her brother Mitch Marczewski created. The two specifically gave rise to such charity work to help other women diagnosed with breast cancer.</p><p>“This album doesn’t pit emotions against one another, but rather it shows joy can come through sorrow,” Marczewski said in a press release. “Jane would be so proud of this album, but more than that, she’d be proud of the work that the Nightbirde Foundation is doing to help others find hope and healing in the midst of tragedy.”</p><p>At the moment, It’s OK is already available for pre-order. Meanwhile, fans can currently pre-save the digital album on Spotify and download it on iTunes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>It’s OK Has Two Parts</h2><p>As a “reflection of her strength,” Nightbirde recorded each track during her journey with her sickness. The album is divided into two, an A and B side. The first is a pop album while the second one features the same songs in a stripped-back version.</p><p>Coming from the title of the album itself, fans will be able to stream her original song “It’s OK.” Other tracks from the collection are “Brave,” “Girl in a Bubble,” and “NYE.”</p><p>“We miss Jane terribly, but are so glad her work to bring hope and healing to others continues, even with her being in Heaven,” the Instagram caption reads.</p><p>The album will be fully released on March 10. Nevertheless, once fans have pre-ordered and pre-saved the album, they will have access to Nightbirde’s essay titled “Cancer Made Me Whole.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_JimmieAllen_AxelleBauer-GriffinFilmMagic-220x147.jpg alt="Jimmie Allen Says He Wouldn’t Sing the National Anthem at the Super Bowl" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>nightbirde</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKeoaySnr%2BlsdJmp6irpJ3CrrvUrGSdnZKqwW6ty5uspmWZqHqvu9ZmmK%2BZmaGuo7jEZp2oql2lv6Z5zqubnqpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
