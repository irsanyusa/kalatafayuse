But sometimes, a&nbsp;random finding, which might seem very harmless, can put an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;all our trust in&nbsp;our partner. Just like it&nbsp;happened to&nbsp;our today’s protagonist, a&nbsp;woman, who read her husband’s diary and found out some really creepy things from its entries. Now the desperate wife and mom has only one question, “Should I&nbsp;run away from my&nbsp;<a href=# title=spouse data-link=tag>spouse</a> immediately?”</p><p><h2>Angela’s marriage to&nbsp;her husband started with some red flags.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d6c/6bb/fec316527cafe96b719ecee9a4.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman, 33, named Angela, wrote a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial and told&nbsp;us her story, which provoked many <a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a> inside our team. The woman asked&nbsp;us to&nbsp;publish her letter, because she wanted to&nbsp;share her problem with our readers and find out what other people think about the devastating situation that Angela appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in.</p><p>Angela started her letter, saying, “I&nbsp;and my&nbsp;husband Andrew have been married for 5&nbsp;years now. We&nbsp;have known each other for 10&nbsp;years in&nbsp;total, and had been dating for 3&nbsp;years before we&nbsp;tied the knot. Our marriage was very happy, though it&nbsp;started with a&nbsp;<a href=# title="red flag" data-link=tag>red flag</a> that&nbsp;I wish&nbsp;I hadn’t ignored at&nbsp;the time being.”</p><p>Angela revealed, “When Andrew proposed to&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;expected him to&nbsp;give me&nbsp;some nice engagement ring, because he&nbsp;did have a&nbsp;very good income and could afford&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;used to&nbsp;spoil&nbsp;me, buying me&nbsp;expensive presents before, so&nbsp;I was obviously expecting something nice on&nbsp;that special day.<br>But Andrew showed up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;very cheap ring, and when he&nbsp;saw the expression of&nbsp;a&nbsp;slight disappointment on&nbsp;my&nbsp;face, he&nbsp;said, ’All material things are just things. You can’t bring anything material along with you to&nbsp;the grave, so&nbsp;I think you should be&nbsp;happy and grateful with what&nbsp;I feel for you, not with what&nbsp;I give you.’”</p><p>Angela wrote, “I&nbsp;have never been a&nbsp;material person, so&nbsp;I didn’t bother much about that cheap ring, I&nbsp;just felt awkward because of&nbsp;this sudden change in&nbsp;his behavior. With our engagement, he&nbsp;just went from a&nbsp;sincere and generous man to&nbsp;a&nbsp;frugal person with some strange philosophy which&nbsp;I don’t remember him having before. So, I&nbsp;ignored this gesture and his words about bringing something to&nbsp;the grave. I&nbsp;was just happy with what&nbsp;I had at&nbsp;that moment.”</p><p><h2>The relationship between spouses was normal, until one day.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bae/464/c71771562ba8bacf6fcfb82bae.jpg><p>Angela goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, “Andrew has kept a&nbsp;semi-regular diary throughout our 5-year marriage. He&nbsp;never kept it&nbsp;hidden, and up&nbsp;until now&nbsp;I have always respected his privacy. We&nbsp;had a&nbsp;heated conversation one day and my&nbsp;gut just told me&nbsp;to&nbsp;read&nbsp;it, so&nbsp;after he&nbsp;left for work, I&nbsp;did.”</p><p>The woman was shocked while she was going through the pages of&nbsp;her husband’s journal. She revealed, “After reading this diary, I&nbsp;wish&nbsp;I had never even touched&nbsp;it, so&nbsp;shocked and disgusted I&nbsp;felt. My&nbsp;dear, my&nbsp;beloved husband wrote several times that he&nbsp;hates&nbsp;me, and at&nbsp;one point he&nbsp;wrote when&nbsp;I was sick he&nbsp;hoped&nbsp;I would die.”</p><p>Angela explained, “We&nbsp;did have a&nbsp;rough patch recently that lasted about two weeks. It&nbsp;was quite a&nbsp;dark time for&nbsp;us both, but&nbsp;I believed we&nbsp;pulled through. There was no&nbsp;offense, no&nbsp;moments where&nbsp;I was afraid of&nbsp;him, just open and honest conversations about difficult feelings.<br>Andrew’s notes of&nbsp;hatred coincided with the period of&nbsp;that rough patch. The rest of&nbsp;the journal was quite tame and reflected the man&nbsp;I know and <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>. There were his thoughts around his work and <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> stuff, goals, habit tracking, etc.”</p><p><h2>Angela can’t sleep well at&nbsp;night after revealing her husband’s real thoughts about her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f8e/025/b6dd2355758653106d2ac8345f.jpg><p>Angela revealed, “When I&nbsp;read those words, I&nbsp;immediately packed up&nbsp;my&nbsp;and our daughter’s things and went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend’s where I’m staying now. I&nbsp;took pictures of&nbsp;all the pages in&nbsp;his diary. I&nbsp;told him&nbsp;I just needed some space to&nbsp;cool off after our conversation and&nbsp;I would be&nbsp;home soon. I&nbsp;booked a&nbsp;session with my&nbsp;therapist and even contacted a&nbsp;lawyer.”</p><p>The woman wrote, “My&nbsp;husband has sent me&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;warm messages since I&nbsp;left. He&nbsp;said he’s glad I’m taking space for myself, that he&nbsp;looks forward to&nbsp;meeting me&nbsp;when&nbsp;I come home, it’s ok&nbsp;to&nbsp;have little hiccups, that he&nbsp;loves me&nbsp;etc.”</p><p>But the woman doesn’t know what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;now. She wrote, “I&nbsp;was sure our relationship was completely over the moment&nbsp;I read that he&nbsp;hates&nbsp;me. Even the moment&nbsp;I felt the need to&nbsp;violate his privacy was a&nbsp;sign that nothing is&nbsp;good in&nbsp;our relationship anymore. All his warm messages and the rest of&nbsp;the diary entries have me&nbsp;wavering a&nbsp;little.”</p><p><h2>Angela doesn’t feel safe with her husband anymore.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/28a/28d/0362995af08232c363c6b6dd20.jpg><p>Angela confessed, “I&nbsp;understand that my&nbsp;husband had the need to&nbsp;blow off his steam when things between&nbsp;us were especially tense. I&nbsp;believe keeping a&nbsp;private diary is&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy way to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that and to&nbsp;release the emotions.<br>But never in&nbsp;even our darkest moments have&nbsp;I fantasized about my&nbsp;husband’s death. I&nbsp;might have thought about anything, even splitting up&nbsp;maybe, but what he&nbsp;wrote just feels so&nbsp;sinister. I&nbsp;don’t know how&nbsp;I could ever feel safe around my&nbsp;husband again.”</p><p>Angela added, “Now I’m constantly thinking about one thing, whether this was just healthy venting, and I’m overreacting here. I&nbsp;can’t believe many people have had similar thoughts about a&nbsp;spouse. I&nbsp;wonder if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;man&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;protect myself and my&nbsp;baby from.<br>I’d like to&nbsp;mention also that our rough patch was about his feelings for another woman. Andrew didn’t cheat on&nbsp;me, but his <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> with her had been making me&nbsp;uncomfortable. The part of&nbsp;the diary where he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;hates me&nbsp;was written as&nbsp;a&nbsp;love letter to&nbsp;her. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;was thinking about me&nbsp;dying and being replaced.”</p><p>And here’s yet another story, which has the least expected twist in&nbsp;the end. A&nbsp;woman, who found some random <a href=#>tampons</a> in&nbsp;her husband’s car, made her own investigation about their origin, thinking that he&nbsp;was cheating. To&nbsp;her shock, the truth turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;even more striking, and now the woman just wants to&nbsp;run away from her creepy husband.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuvsSam2alqWK1tr%2FBmqWdq12ZtqK%2B2GaYp5xdp7K3scClnJ1lkWKxpsLArKuarJmjtG7A0a6roWWkna61v4yemK2hnpx6rrGMn6mopV2eu7S1w55kcWlobIVzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
