Irish botanist and cleric Caleb Threlkeld <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">described the connection</a> in 1726, when he also wrote that the shamrock was the emblem of the holiday and the country’s national symbol.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, historians say the story is likely fiction, as the plant itself is mythical and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not linked to a scientific species</a>, according to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> National Geographic. </a>The shamrock became associated more broadly with Ireland as a symbol during rebellions against Britain in the 18th century.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Green became connected to St. Patrick’s Day after Irish rebellions&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Green as an Irish color has political origins. Timothy McMahon, Vice President of the American Conference for Irish Studies, previously<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> told TIME </a>the color dates back to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Great Irish Rebellion of 1641</a>, where Catholic local leaders revolted against the English crown, using a green flag with a harp as an emblem.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Green was worn again during the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Irish Rebellion of 1798</a>. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Irish forces promoted </a>the nationalistic ballad “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wearing of the Green,</a>” which immortalized the color’s connection with Ireland.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Before these rebellions, blue was traditionally associated with Ireland, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Smithsonian Magazine reported.</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The first St. Patrick’s Day parade was held in the U.S.&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The first recorded parade on the Catholic Feast Day of St. Patrick <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was held </a>on March 17, 1601, in a Spanish colony in modern-day St. Augustine, Florida. More than a century later, Irish soldiers serving in the English military<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> marched</a> in Boston in 1737 and in New York City in 1762.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>St. Patrick’s Day was promoted by the Irish government&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Inspired by Irish-Americans, Ireland’s National Agricultural and Industrial Association organized a parade in Dublin in the early 1950s to showcase Irish industry, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the National Museum of Ireland.</a> Dublin Tourism took over the parade from 1970, until a St. Patrick’s Day Committee was established in 1995, which grew the festival into a weekend and then a week.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The government established the weeklong St. Patrick’s Day Festival in 1995, Irish news outlet <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Journal</a> reported. The holiday was boosted that year by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an Irish government campaign</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Leprechauns originated in Irish folklore&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The supernatural fairies, or sprites, were thought to bring good luck and protection to humans, or to mess up their plans. The oldest written reference to leprechauns was in a medieval story about three magical fairies, or sprites, who drug the King of Ulster into the ocean, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">National Geographic.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The legend gained popularity in the 19th century, when leprechauns were painted as grouchy shoemakers who guarded gold. Walt Disney’s depiction of a more cheerful leprechaun kicked off the current commercialized image.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Lucky” four-leaf clovers are real—but rare</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Although common three-leaf clovers are most closely associated with the saint and his holiday, much ado has been made about “lucky” four-leaf clovers. Vincent Pennetti, a doctoral student at the University of Georgia’s College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told the Associated Press</a> that it takes a recessive trait to develop a fourth leaf, so although the plants are rare, they’re real.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>An American union started dyeing the Chicago River green decades ago</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of the most iconic St. Patrick’s Day celebrations in the U.S. is Chicago <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">temporarily dyeing the river that shares its name green</a> using <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">about 40 pounds</a> of environmentally friendly dye.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Starting in 1955, city workers used green dye to help identify the source of sewage in the river, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NPR reported</a>. The inspiration to dye the entire river came after Stephen Bailey, the business manager for the Chicago Journeymen Plumbers Local Union, <a href=#>noticed a plumber’s white overalls</a> stained with bright green, per chicagoist. The tradition began in 1962 when the Plumbers Local Union dyed the river green with 100 pounds of dye for a week, according to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Illinois’ tourism website</a>, and continues today.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On March 16, ahead of the official St. Patrick’s Day 2024 celebrations, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago dyed its river</a> emerald green as spectators looked on.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Corned beef and cabbage is an Irish-American invention&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The dish is not common in Ireland,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> news outlet IrishCentral reported.</a> Instead, Irish immigrants to the U.S.<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> reportedly found</a> a less expensive alternative to the meat more common in their home country—bacon—in beef. They cured the beef using corn-sized crystals, hence the moniker “corned.” The beef was then paired with cabbage, one of the cheapest vegetables available. So while people in the U.S. may see corned beef and cabbage on themed St. Patrick’s Day menus, it’s highly unlikely people in Ireland will be offered the delicacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWVsg3iCjqyrZqiRqb%2Bqr8qsZJ2ZqWKzoq%2FTrGShoaOpvLPFjK2prp1dqMGwvtho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
