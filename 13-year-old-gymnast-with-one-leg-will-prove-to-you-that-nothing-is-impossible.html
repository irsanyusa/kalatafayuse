Her performance wowed the judges, especially fellow athlete Federica Pellegrini. Check out Giorgia’s performance in the video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-13-year-old-gymnast-auditions-for-italia-s-got-talent>13-Year-Old Gymnast Auditions For ‘Italia’s Got Talent’</h2><p>Before Giorgia’s Italia’s Got Talent audition, her mother explained that she had been doing rhythmic gymnastics since she was four years old. At seven years old, she was diagnosed with a bone tumor in her leg, which had to be amputated.</p><p>Giorgia thought she might not be able to be a gymnast anymore. However, one day she had an “epiphany” and did a handstand against the wall, realizing that she could still do what she loved without both legs.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <a href=#>SEXY HAND BALANCER ADDS ADORABLE DOG TO HIS ACT ON ‘ITALIA’S GOT TALENT’ [VIDEO]</a></p><p>For her audition, Giorgia performed a floor routine involving rolls, jump rope tricks, and even hula-hooping. The audience gave her a standing ovation, and chanted for the judges to hit the Golden Buzzer.</p><p>After the performance, Giorgia said she was “relieved” and “happy,” because she thought the audition would go worse. The judges assured her that it went well.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyz8pH9bQh4</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-the-judges-think-of-giorgia-s-audition>What Did The Judges Think Of Giorgia’s Audition?</h3><p>“I love when people with passion and talent push themselves to the ultimate limit and tell the world, ‘I am so brave, so good, and so talented,'” judge Frank Matano told Giorgia. He added that Giorgia’s performance “will be really important for a lot of people.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=#>THE ‘ITALIA’S GOT TALENT’ PERFORMANCE THAT IS GIVING THE INTERNET GOOSEBUMPS</a></strong></p><p>Giorgia told the judges that she can’t compete professionally, “because there are no other girls like me.” Judge Federica Pellegrini, who is a swimmer, told Giorgia that “new things will surely happen” for her.</p><p>Federica then told Giorgia that she would be competing in the finale of Italia’s Got Talent, and hit the Golden Buzzer for her. Giorgia burst into tears as the gold confetti rained down on the stage and Federica gave her a hug.</p><p>Unfortunately, Giorgia didn’t end up winning the competition, but we’re sure this is just the beginning for her journey.
