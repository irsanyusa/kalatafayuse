From there, we researched the top brands and models, then searched through countless reviews.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Do tennis shoes make a difference in tennis?</h3><p>Tennis shoes, versus other athletic shoes, are engineered specifically for the distinct movements and physical requirements of the sport, such as pivoting quickly and lateral motions.</p><h3>Is it better for tennis shoes to be tight or loose?</h3><p>The right tennis shoe should fit snugly without feeling too tight, which can cause foot and toe pain. Too loose, though, and your shoe can slide and cause blisters. Experts suggest roughly a half an inch between your big toe and the tip of the shoe. A trained professional can help you determine the best size for you.</p><h3>Should tennis shoes be heavy or light?</h3><p>Lighter shoes provide more agility during play, while heavier shoes may offer higher durability and support. Both can work for players, depending on age, size, weight, and play level.</p><h3>Should I wash my tennis shoes?</h3><p>Sports retailers generally do not recommend washing tennis shoes in the washing machine, as it will break down the shoe’s special construction over time, decreasing efficacy. Rather, try hand-washing your shoes with a mild detergent and brush and allowing them to air dry. This will prevent unnecessary wear and tear and extend shoe longevity.</p><h3>How can you tell you need new tennis shoes?</h3><p>A few clues can help indicate when you should consider purchasing new tennis shoes. Depending on how often you play or wear the shoes, over time they will start to wear down in key areas, losing traction in the outer sole and shock absorption in the midsole. Often, physical symptoms, like shin splints or ankle soreness, could signal that it’s time to consider new shoes. Podiatric sports experts recommended swapping out shoes after a year, even if they don’t appear worn.</p><p>The information presented here is created by TIME Stamped and overseen by TIME editorial staff.
