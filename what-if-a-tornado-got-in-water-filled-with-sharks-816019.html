This tornado is&nbsp;unique not by&nbsp;its color but by&nbsp;what is&nbsp;hidden inside&nbsp;it. These are great white sharks, hammerhead sharks, tiger sharks, and bull sharks.</p><p>Shark! They fly inside the hurricane, snapping their jaws and trying to&nbsp;grab a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;meat. People who look at&nbsp;this bizarre phenomenon from the outside think that they’ve got something in&nbsp;their drinks, but this is&nbsp;reality. A&nbsp;shark tornado can really exist. Or&nbsp;not? Let’s find out.</p><p>In&nbsp;<strong>1877</strong>, a&nbsp;rather unusual tornado struck a&nbsp;farm in&nbsp;<strong>Southern California</strong>. About six small alligators about 1&nbsp;foot in&nbsp;length fell from the sky that day. In&nbsp;<strong>1894</strong>, a&nbsp;tornado traveled through <a href=# title=England data-link=tag>England</a> and dropped poisonous jellyfish on&nbsp;people. There’s a&nbsp;version that tadpoles instead of&nbsp;jellyfish fell on&nbsp;the ground that day&nbsp;— but it&nbsp;still sounds quite strange.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4f0/3b2/2c12c6590eaa5b3cb1a8a869ba.png><p>In&nbsp;<strong>Kentucky</strong> in&nbsp;<strong>1876</strong>, there was black humor rain. Doesn’t sound funny to&nbsp;me. Pieces of&nbsp;meat fell from the sky. The locals tasted them and said it&nbsp;was like mutton or&nbsp;venison. However, later, experts discovered that a&nbsp;flock of&nbsp;buzzards had flown over that area. The birds felt unwell and regurgitated their lunch right in&nbsp;the air. And then, I&nbsp;assume, so&nbsp;did the locals who tried&nbsp;it.</p><p>In&nbsp;1947, <a href=# title=fish data-link=tag>fish</a> fell from the sky in&nbsp;Marksville, Louisiana. In&nbsp;2005, there was rain that contained thousands of&nbsp;frogs in&nbsp;Serbia. In&nbsp;2010, a&nbsp;small town in&nbsp;Australia was hit by&nbsp;a&nbsp;rain of&nbsp;perches, you know, fish. . And now imagine that all these strange phenomena were caused by&nbsp;one villainous corporation where evil geniuses work&nbsp;— and one of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;you. So, you decide to&nbsp;make the most incredible natural cataclysm in&nbsp;history&nbsp;— a&nbsp;tornado of&nbsp;sharks. Or&nbsp;<strong>sharknado</strong>. It&nbsp;seems like it’s impossible, but you’re going to&nbsp;try. Because you have nothing better to&nbsp;do.</p><p>So, first, we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;understand what a&nbsp;<strong>waterspout</strong>&nbsp;is. It’s a&nbsp;column of&nbsp;rotating air filled with clouds. This vortex occurs during a&nbsp;thunderstorm when warm air releases a&nbsp;large amount of&nbsp;heat. This heat becomes the energy that moves the rising air currents. This warm moist air goes&nbsp;up, and cold, dry air descends. The difference between temperatures preserves instability and helps tornadoes develop. When it&nbsp;forms over the water, a&nbsp;tornado becomes a&nbsp;waterspout.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7b5/683/37d6635fc1aaa05639a78683a1.png><p>It&nbsp;can draw in&nbsp;particles of&nbsp;seawater, some objects, and even fish. But everything depends on&nbsp;the strength of&nbsp;this vortex. You’ve probably seen it&nbsp;when tornadoes lifted cars into the air or&nbsp;tore the roofs off of&nbsp;buildings. There’s a&nbsp;video on&nbsp;the Internet where a&nbsp;tornado raises cows into the air. And an&nbsp;ordinary cow weighs about 1,400&nbsp;pounds! <strong>Moo</strong>!</p><p>In&nbsp;comparison, the great white shark is&nbsp;about 4,400&nbsp;pounds. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;tornado could lift several cows, it&nbsp;could cope with a&nbsp;shark. But besides the great white one, there are tiger sharks, bull sharks, and hammerhead fish. All of&nbsp;them weigh less. Therefore, there’s no&nbsp;doubt that a&nbsp;tornado could possibly lift them into the air too.</p><p>Okay, now we&nbsp;can assume it’s in&nbsp;the realm of&nbsp;possibilities. The next step is&nbsp;to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;real <strong>tornado</strong>. To&nbsp;do&nbsp;this, you need to&nbsp;heat the <strong>[warm] air</strong> and then make it&nbsp;rotate <strong>[updraft].</strong> The <strong>cold air</strong> will start to&nbsp;go&nbsp;down, and you will get a&nbsp;whirlwind <strong>[thunderstorm]</strong>. One engineer from Canada named Louis built devices that created tornadoes. He&nbsp;made several prototypes before assembling a&nbsp;real vortex engine.</p><p>According to&nbsp;him, anyone can do&nbsp;it. However, these vortices were small. His device created thin jets of&nbsp;air that swirled and produced mini-tornadoes, which then quickly dissipated due to&nbsp;strong winds. Louis started developing this idea to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;new source of&nbsp;electricity. But he&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;giant vortex that would go&nbsp;into the sky to&nbsp;power several houses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e83/328/1d3ef65075a0853b575fe3a76d.png><p>He&nbsp;didn’t have enough finances and opportunities to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this. But the place where you work has enough money to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it. You take the concept of&nbsp;the vortex engine and invest several million dollars. You build several large turbines that direct air to&nbsp;one point and then heat it&nbsp;with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;powerful generator. To&nbsp;give your tornado more destructive power, you electrify the atmosphere. You can control the tornado and change its direction using a&nbsp;special control panel. You little evil mad scientist, you!</p><p>So, you come to&nbsp;the coast of&nbsp;Australia, where there are many sharks of&nbsp;different species. To&nbsp;force them to&nbsp;gather in&nbsp;one place, you must throw several tons of&nbsp;minced meat into the water near the shore. Let me&nbsp;suggest that you don’t do&nbsp;this by&nbsp;hand. The sharks immediately come there as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;they smell the food. But there’s a&nbsp;problem. These animals feel changes in&nbsp;the weather and don’t approach the center of&nbsp;the storm. Therefore, to&nbsp;make sharks take risks, you need to&nbsp;make them angry and hungry enough. You go, Dr. Doofenshmirtz! [from Disney’s Phineas and Ferb]</p><p>You spend millions of&nbsp;dollars to&nbsp;organize large-scale fishing. You throw huge nets into the water and, within a&nbsp;week, catch all the fish, shellfish, and other marine life that can become dinner for sharks. You move all the prey into giant aquariums and wait for the sharks to&nbsp;get hungry. A&nbsp;few days later, you notice many big fish congregating near the shore, looking for food.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f5e/0ef/dff9ce54c4b77673e322f86bf5.png><p>Then, you buy a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;ground beef from several butcher shops. You put it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;large container and lift it&nbsp;with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;helicopter. You dump the meat in&nbsp;the place where you see a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;sharks. Lunch attracts fish within a&nbsp;1-mile radius. At&nbsp;this moment, a&nbsp;large ship with the tornado generator approaches the shore. Hey, can’t quit now, right?</p><p>You start the engines, and strong flows of&nbsp;warm air accumulate in&nbsp;the sky. Electricity flashes, and condensation creates rain. A&nbsp;powerful vortex begins to&nbsp;form in&nbsp;the sky. You control it&nbsp;and direct it&nbsp;toward the sharks. The whirlwind pulls pieces of&nbsp;ground beef from the water. The dust particles mix with the meat, and the tornado turns red. Oh, I&nbsp;think I’m gonna barf!</p><p>You increase the strength of&nbsp;the wind and see how the sharks begin to&nbsp;rise into the air. More precisely, they jump out of&nbsp;the water to&nbsp;grab the meat, and the tornado picks them&nbsp;up. When several sharks are inside the vortex, you direct them toward the shore. People are running in&nbsp;horror. Some sharks fall back into the water, and some fall to&nbsp;the beach. The hammerhead shark falls right into the kitchen of&nbsp;a&nbsp;coastal restaurant and eats the whole menu. The shark is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;pig.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/927/f59/ec604551138e5a5751e7b08bab.png><p>You direct the sharknado into the city. The storm lifts trees and cars into the air and rips off the roofs of&nbsp;houses. Some sharks fall down to&nbsp;the streets. People are running in&nbsp;different directions. The shark vortex passes through the city, scattering sharks.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, sharks don’t crawl on&nbsp;the ground and don’t try to&nbsp;eat people. They’re just in&nbsp;shock and don’t understand what’s going&nbsp;on. What can I&nbsp;say, it’s a&nbsp;PG sharknado. Even in&nbsp;the ocean, sharks don’t like to&nbsp;bite people. All attacks occur because sharks mistake them for seals or&nbsp;other sea creatures, which look like food.</p><p>Also, toothy fish can swim up&nbsp;to&nbsp;people out of&nbsp;curiosity. And now they are disoriented and have big breathing problems. Fish need a&nbsp;constant flow of&nbsp;water passing through their oxygen-extracting gills. Depending on&nbsp;the species, sharks can last without water for several minutes to&nbsp;an&nbsp;hour. At&nbsp;this moment, you realize that you have carried out not a&nbsp;villainous plan but a&nbsp;stupid thing that has caused so&nbsp;many fish to&nbsp;suffer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/58a/f9f/d27e0c5056a4ca1cdf5de7404e.png><p>Now you need to&nbsp;fix everything. You have several helicopters that can transport the fish back to&nbsp;the ocean. But they are twitching and snapping their jaws in&nbsp;fear. Therefore, to&nbsp;calm them down, you use darts with sedatives. Then you help rescuers to&nbsp;fasten the sharks to&nbsp;helicopters and lift them into the air. You have to&nbsp;get one fish out of&nbsp;an&nbsp;apartment on&nbsp;the seventh floor.</p><p>Another shark was lying in&nbsp;the park. A&nbsp;hammerhead one caused a&nbsp;big traffic jam on&nbsp;the road. And this tiger shark fell on&nbsp;a&nbsp;fire truck. Fortunately, they all have tough skin and strong muscles that protect them from damage. You pick up&nbsp;all the sharks and move them back to&nbsp;the ocean.</p><p>No&nbsp;one and nothing has been hurt except for one thing. Your reputation. You have failed your villainous plan and need to&nbsp;develop something new. This time, you will create something that will really terrify people. You will invent a&nbsp;YouTube Channel with nothing but ads! ALTERNATE ENDING: You will invent a&nbsp;mega-flood of&nbsp;spiders! Ew!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmoJ9lkWLBsL7NmpuoZZekwW61zWaumqyVp3qntculnJ1lp57BqXnSoZiro6NihXKCj2pwaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
