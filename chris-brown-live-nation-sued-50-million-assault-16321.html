In addition to the payment, the four plaintiffs are asking for a temporary restraining order against all defendants.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to the complaint, which was first reported by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TMZ</a> and obtained by Variety, Brown and his crew severely beat the plaintiffs following the singer’s performance as part of his 11:11 Tour at Dickies Arena in Ft. Worth, Texas this past Friday. The four men were invited backstage after the set to meet Brown, who showed up 30 minutes later than anticipated.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Before leaving, Bush approached Brown to congratulate him on the show, prompting a member of the singer’s entourage to remind Brown that the two previously had issues. Brown allegedly said, “Oh yeah, we were. What’s up, n—a? I don’t forget shit.” The suit states that Brown and seven to 10 members of his entourage proceeded to assault Bush and punch him in the chest, and claims that Hood Boss picked up a chair and threw it at Bush’s head.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The suit goes on to claim that Brown and his crew turned their attention to Parker, who tried to escape down a staircase that led to a locked door. Upon instruction from Brown, Parker was allegedly punched in the face and chest and kicked in the head for over 10 minutes. The suit also states that Powell was punched in the shoulder, while Lewis was hit in the shoulder and chest. All plaintiffs were injured and are currently undergoing medical treatment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Representatives for Brown, Beezy and Live Nation did not respond to Variety‘s request for comment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“No should have to endure what these clients endured,” said the plaintiffs’ attorney Tony Buzbee in a statement shared with Variety. “We will seek the maximum amount of damages allowed by law for this egregious conduct.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This marks the latest legal issue for Brown, who has been accused of violent misconduct in the past. In 2009, he pleaded guilty to assaulting his then-girlfriend Rihanna, and three years later was involved in an altercation with Drake at a New York City club. His former manager sued him for assault and battery in 2016, and a year later his ex-girlfriend Karreuche Tran got a five-year restraining order against him over alleged threats.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpWPDor7InquyZpOkunB%2Bj2traKWlqLake82erqxnk52%2Fqr%2BMm6mor55iuarCxGalmqyZpLtuv9Sem2ZtYGK6qrjLoqanZZGowKLBy61kam5jZ35w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
