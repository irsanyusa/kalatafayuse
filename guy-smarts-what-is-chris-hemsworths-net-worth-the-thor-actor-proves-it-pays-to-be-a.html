But just how much money has Thor, God of Thunder, been able to rake in? Well, let's just say he could buy himself a pretty nice place in Asgard.</p><p>Here's everything we know about Chris Hemsworth's net worth.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-4>Chris Hemsworth made $37 million in 2014.</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The Australian actor began his career in his home country in 2002, where he made minor appearances on&nbsp;various television shows&nbsp;before becoming a series regular on&nbsp;Home and Away&nbsp;from 2004 to 2007.</p><p>His first big Hollywood break came in 2009, when he appeared as&nbsp;George Kirk, Captain Kirk's father, in&nbsp;Star Trek. He became a bonafide household name two years later, when he wielded his hammer as the leading man in&nbsp;Thor. The film made more than $65 million its opening weekend, and has gone on to gross nearly $450 million worldwide.</p><p>In 2014 - the year after&nbsp;Thor: The Dark World&nbsp;hit theaters -&nbsp;Forbes&nbsp;reported that Hemsworth raked in $37 million, making him one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors of the year.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>Chris Hemsworth made $27 million in 2015.</h3></p><p>It may have been a dip from his 2014 earnings, but $27 million was still enough to earn him 15th place on&nbsp;Forbes' list of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood that year.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Hemsworth&nbsp;dropped off the list in 2016. But don't worry: He made a comeback.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-11>Chris Hemsworth earned $31.5 million in 2017.</h3></p><p>In 2017,&nbsp;Forbes&nbsp;named Hemsworth the 11th highest-paid actor in Hollywood. By that point, he had a host of Marvel movies under his belt, including&nbsp;Thor: The Dark World&nbsp;and&nbsp;Avengers: Age of Ultron.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>Chris Hemsworth earned $64.5 million in 2018.</h3></p><p>Yup, you read that right: In 2018, Hemsworth more than doubled his salary from the previous year, according to&nbsp;Forbes. It didn't hurt that&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War&nbsp;shattered more box office records&nbsp;than we can wrap our heads around.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-15>Chris Hemsworths net worth is probably between $60 and $90 million.</h3></p><p>Reports vary as to Hemsworth's total net worth.&nbsp;CelebrityNetWorth.com&nbsp;places it at $90 million;&nbsp;The Richest&nbsp;at $71 million; and&nbsp;Bankrate&nbsp;at $60 million. (Hey, they all sound good to us.) And with plenty more movies to come, odds are the estimates will keep getting higher.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLqmutJmn56ZnKm1cLPUsmSspZGnwbR51qGYrWWZqHqktNGiqmaglaLAuLvRrZ%2BsZZ6awW7DzquroWWknbJuwMeoqWaZk6m8s3nPq6avnaNitrV5z5qwrGWkpHqjsYyaZqVvk2W9o7A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
